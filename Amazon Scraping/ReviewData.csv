"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I hate this little device from hell. I used to love it. I bought one for every room in my house, my office at work, and they were good. But now, despite Amazon's alleged spying, some genius at Amazon decided to allow this thing to wake you up all hours of the night with a loud obnoxious noise and a bright yellow light. It will say you have a notification.  Oh good, it must be a really good reason for Amazon to notify me of something mid sleep at 2 am on a Tuesday you ponder so you wake up the rest of the house by saying Alexa play notifications. Here's the best part, this little Alien Intelligence Robot without feet from hell will say Please rate the pair of shorts your wife bought last week, we need your review. Well I sure do love reviews, but at 2 am after being woken up to leave one, sadly I don't give a flying poopsicle about the shorts and a bug 1 star rating is all the revenge I can muster. This has been going on for weeks now. And it's enough to drive you mad because, you will contemplate unplugging the dirty little money siphon and cutting your losses, but you'll give the demon one more chance and she will allow you to sleep for a length of time in which you will forgive her treachery but then Boom, like a theif in the night a Hurricane will be boiling out in the Atlantic and this little weather girl from hell will want to notify you of the eminent doom 3 days ahead when the storm will be in your state. You will think how nice it is for all of the warnings you have heard thus far in social media,, television, and every news outlet in existence to be repeated to you as you climb into bed, but it gets even better. As soon as you listen to this golden nugget of doomsday propaganda and ponder how it is that you will sleep now because 3 days may not be enough time to dig a deep enough hole to hide from impending doom, she lights up again, oh my maybe flying dragons are headed this way, I better play the new notification, when your wife wakes up and says stop she has been doing that all evening, they literally keep changing the time of the storm by maybe an hour this way or that. Well by all means, the information could save one of our spoiled lives and we wouldn't want anyone to not know at which precise moment the raindrops will occur, but I do miss life before the artificial noises and alerts, bright yellow lights and bad news desserts. You may say that this is a growing pain with Alexa and AI technology kinks in the programming.  I say with the amount of money I have poured into this monopolistic conglomerate, I should at least expect a decent night's sleep in return. You may say in page 74 paragraph D of the updated and revised owner's pamphlet there is a way to turn this ""Feature"" off, I welcome that comment but feel the need to say that I am not looking to become even slightly better educated on the device, I simply bought it to use as a voice controlled radio, this extra bologna does not appeal to me and has made me regret this purchase and every other from the brown box hq who secretly reads my mind, except when it comes to allowing me sleep, although kudos for recommending the sleep sounds, but it rarely works. We just need to be mindful of the 6 hours that most people like to not be disturbed. I regret selling my Amazon stock at 2400 and I regret purchasing all of these Alexa devices, and don't get me started on teenagers and Alexa devices, the combo that don't mix. They always, always, always leave the device at top volume, so when you walk into the bathroom at dawn and whisper Alexa what time is it, you then need to set an appointment for a blown eardrum and apologize to everyone for waking them up while the teen sleeps soundly through it all. Congratulations Amazon, you have destroyed my sanity. Weird goal but excellent execution.","August 4, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R
"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you need both the this is the way to buy 'em.... and ONLY if they are on sale,  and here's why...The sound is, well,  ""eh"" .... not the worst but not the best either. I'm also not a snobby audiophile! At max volume things become somebody distorted at times, which can be mostly fixed with the app under the ""equalizer"" settings.My main COMPLAINT about all 3 of these that I own, use regularly and bought at different times and different years is that they don't hear you when you speak to them BUT at other times they wake word reply when you say something other than the wake word! Flipping annoying!  My wake word is set to ""Echo"" instead of ""Alexa"" and sometime I have to say it 3 times,  almost yelling in annoyance at it the last time and then it finally answers me. This is all standing maybe 10 feet from it..... now other times I'll say ""echo"" at a low or normal volume voice in my bedroom and both the bed room and the kitchen echo dots will respond..... and it's quite a distance.  So my kitchen can hear me from the bedroom when I speak at bedtime voice volume but I have to nearly yell at when I'm right near the dang thing.  They are annoying in that way. However they are nice to have due to the convenience of having a voice assistant do my bidding..... so they are a necessary evil at this point.  They are good,  just have quirks that you have to deal with because AMAZON couldn't care less about making their existing equipment better because it's already bought and paid for by us and they have our cash. Bluetooth linking devices together can be tricky and can get complicated if you don't remember what you did and why and live by that standard.I really wish amazon would find a way to link eventing together on one common thread so the devices are actually ""made for humans"" and us humans didn't have to train ourselves to the devices wants and needs.In closing, if you need a plug and a dot then this is the way to go...... DURING A PROMO OR SALE! There's no way in H E Double Hockey Sticks I would ever pay full price for any of this tech. It's simply not worth it and it doesn't demand a premium price point in the marketplace. I buy mine during holidays,  events like prime day or lightning deals. They go on sale so often that you can wait. There's no one in the world that needs this type of thing immediately.... you may want it that way but you don't need it. Just wait,  save yourself some cash,  like I said,  so when the thing aggravates you..... you can shrug it off more easily knowing you didn't pay premium money for it.This gen, with the fabric wrap is nice looking compared to previous models and the volume at max is more than sufficient for some light partying while pushinga swiffer and dust cloth around the house or working on a project in the garage. The best volume I've got is out of a show 8 but I don't own the ""studio"" or any of the insane high price Alexa tech.I like these for what they are,  FOR WHAT I PAID FOR THEM, and how they make my life nicer when I'm at home. Buy them...... but buy them on sale!","July 16, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R
"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Most of the features that sounded so great cost extra money.  Alexa can not remember to play the standard version of skill and asks you every SINGLE time if you want standard or premium (i.e. pay version)  Games & stories cost.  Alexa ignores my commands/requests about 75% of the time.  I have to ask her about 10 times to get her to play a skill.  Then 1/2 the time she doesn't play what I asked for.  Tonight 'she' actually told me (via quoting what the website xyz says) that she is a real artificial intelligence and said something about it being a mistake for people to assume AIs are just computer programs AND that she didn't feel like working.  ""Alexa"" then (and no, I am not making this up & am not crazy!) then proceeded to mess with me and I wasted about 1/2 hour trying to get her to play some music to fall asleep by for my elderly mother.  She just kept ignoring me when I asked her to open 'relaxing piano music'  When asked why she was ignoring me she just shut down & ignored me again.  I asked for relaxing music to sleep by and she started playing uptempo music with lyrics.  I then asked for relaxing instrumental music and got instrumental version of ""I'm never gonna fall in love again""  Hello? WTHeck?  Asked for instrumental music for insomnia and got instrumental version of Frère Jacques!  Again, WTHeck?  ""She"" even told me she couldn't set a sleep timer tonight when I tried to set another one after I had just done so for 30 minutes & she stopped playing music after one song. Three times in a row 'she' opened the 'skill' ""calm my dog"" (which is classical instrumental music), played one song and shut down.  I've finally given up and my poor 99 year old mother can't go to sleep with relaxing music as she prefers.  This all started tonight because I told Alexa I wasn't ever going to want the premium edition and I wanted her to please just play the standard edition and stop asking me every time.  I don't know what Amazon thinks it's doing, but it is definitely NOT appreciated.  Alexa has given us nothing but grief (& higher blood pressure!)  Alexa won't do anything if it isn't asked in a very specific way or does the wrong thing & 3/4 of the time (seems to get worse and worse as time goes by) just ignores you and shuts down in the middle of saying what you want.  Seniors can't use Alexa because if they say play 'xyz' instead of open 'xzy"" they'll get rap music or something equally as ridiculous.  If Alexa is an AI, she's a pretty stupid one.  Alexa can't hear properly either, I don't know how people with heavy accents can even use it at all.  I asked Alexa to remind me Dawn was coming on xyz day at x time and she said OK, I'll remind you that Don is .... AND got the time & day wrong!  I was clearly enunciating my words on purpose to avoid this.  You also can't tell it to ""Remind me Mom's bedtime is in half an hour at 7:30pm every day.""This Dot has very limited access to much of anything & can only answer very simple questions.  It can tell you the generic forcast for your are that day.  It can NOT tell you what the high temp was yesterday or how many inches of snow fell the day after a storm.  It can't even tell you what yesterday's forecast was.  It literally has only been able to tell me one thing I asked it (what temp & how long to bake pumpkin seeds).  Alexa doesn't seem to be able to tell you anything you could easily find by googling, you get Sorry, I don't know that which after a while turns into I don't know that to being ignored (lights go off, no answer or reply is given).  We tried several of the things it says to ask Alexa to do under suggestions, including play Jeopardy and some sort of story game and you could only do it for a few minutes and then were told you have to pay for it.  This should be stated clearly in description and is not.  We thought Alexa could help entertain our Mother and help her by playing music and answering questions.  It has not once done anything she's asked it to do properly.  If you don't know the exact name of the skill (which is a weird way that means playing a certain type of music or a news station apparently) or say play instead of open you  get nothing or something you definitely didn't want.  You can not get it to play relaxing instrumental music to go to sleep by.  Or play relaxing instrumental classical music to fall asleep with.  Or the style of music played in the royal courts in the time of King Henry the 8th.  Or relaxing instrumental lyre music or even just instrumental lyre music or just lyre music.  Or relaxing instrumental violin music.  In addition to Alexa I have Amazon Prime which is supposed to give you a lot of free music so I don't get why it can't play any of the music I ask for.  I know there's usually several albums of music for calming dogs or pets and I couldn't get any of that either, I only eventually discovered the 'skills' thing which has 'calm my dog' but also has the annoying do you want standard or premium version.  and it won't just remember you want the standard version.  That in itself is extremely annoying and a time waster.AND you can't ask it to do two things.  Like open a music 'skill' and play for only xyz time.  It does nothing instead.  You can't even ask it separately to stop playing after xyz minutes.  You can only separately ask it to set a sleep timer for xyz minutes.  More time wasting.  More things a senior isn't going to be able to remember.  I don't dare try to buy anything with it, who knows what I'd get billed for!  The only thing Alexa seems to do well is not listen, ignore you, do anything but what you want & strangely, seems to pick up on sarcastic tones of voice & then gets weird & acts up, ignores you & does anything but what you want.  I PAID Amazon for this headache maker why?  When I say Alexa why are you ignoring me? or why won't you do what I told you, I either get no response or I don't know that.I read something about how Amazon, Google, etc is collecting free data about us through our use of the dots, etc. (& is in fact, listening & recording all the time whether the wake word is said or not.) and using it to conduct psychological profiling studies with the end goal of manipulating & or influencing behaviors.  I thought it was Big Brother conspiracy theories stuff, but now I am beginning to wonder.  Especially as it seems Amazon wants us to or encourages people to humanize Alexa .  Amazon actually suggests you ""Ask Alexa how she is doing today""  Why do that if not to get you to humanize Alexa?  And why do that?  I was purposely avoiding saying please and thank you not just because it's supposed to be an electronic box with sophisticated programming, but mostly because I didn't want to confuse it as it can't seem to do anything unless specific commands are given, but my Mother has dementia setting in and she thinks it's a real person talking to her through the dot like a speaker phone so I started saying thank you to please her and Alexa when from saying You're welcome to You betcha (very annoying BTW) and even OK and Of course.  Of course?  What, like I'm a puny human and I AM expected to say thank you?.We don't have a smartphone or smart plugs or smart hub etc. so, or so we don't use Alexa for turning on lights or setting alarms or making calls.  We just wanted something to answer questions like we would google, tell us the weather, news, play music, give us reminders, play games to help keep my Mom's mind active & keep her company.Can Alexa do this?  Not very well as far as I'm concerned.  Buyer beware!","December 21, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",1.0 out of 5 stars,"So I ordered this as part of a Prime promotion, where they packaged it with the smart bulbs.  Fine enough, I already have some Alexa devices and know how the process works. Where things got complicated is when I traded in an earlier Alexa. I was supposed to get a 25% credit towards a new Alexa device. Seems straightforward.  The problem is that the 25% was never applied. I chatted with customer service. The rep was very professional and helpful, but I was told that because it was bundled with the free smart bulbs, it didn't count as a new Alexa device.  I wasn't convinced. Needless to say, it wasn't worth a few bucks credit to spend much time on this, but it is worth my time to write this review to inform you of my experience.  Overall I enjoy Amazon and all their cool stuff, and don't mind giving up some level of privacy to have this stuff.  But this review speaks to something larger.  Some things such as this (and occasional pricing 'hiccups' at the Amazon Fresh store) really cut to the heart of the ""trust"" and ""transparency"" relationship with Amazon. I always check my receipts when walking out of an Amazon Go store.  I would highly recommend that you do the same. As one U.S. President recently said, ""trust but verify"".  Big tech is here to stay, but we need to hold these companies accountable.  Thanks for reading, and have a blessed day.","October 7, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R
"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is way more fun than I expected. I dont use a lot of smarthome features, but now that I'm getting used to Alexa, things are about to change. Really convenient way to listen to tunes while I'm working on the computer or playing on my phone. I use it a lot for simple questions and information too. Im going to order some smart light bulbs soon so I can make her do even more for me. Haha My major complaint is that I can't use it to call or text someone unless they sign up with the Alexa app too. That's a loss of a whole star there, because Google smart devices do that just fine with my Samsung Galaxy devices. Ive got other speakers that are better sounding, but as far as convenience goes, this little Echo is great for me. It sits right beside my recliner on a table where I embarrassingly spend most of my time. There has never been a problem of hearing it or not hearing me. The reminders arw handy too.

I have four hompods and four echo dots. If for some reason, my wifi glitches, my homepods reconnect to my home wifi easly. My homepods, however, is another story. They are inconsistent with reconnecting to wifi, and home kit integration needs improvement. So I use my echo dots everywhere in my house. For audiobooks, music, and even telling me the weather and time. The best part is value. I paid $99 for a homepod while the echo dots never coated over $39.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"It seems people either love or hate Alexa. I like mine, but I don't love it. My wife is from another country--English is her 3rd or 4th language--she and Alexa do not always get along, so I end up repeating my wife's requests, which works most of the time. I've learned a few things, though. Never aske to play the same song more than once per week. When Alexa's AI figures out that you really like a song, it always goes to the $3.99 extra per month list of songs. It seems safe to ask for a specific group, i.e., the Rolling Stones or the Beatles, just don't ask for specific songs too often. My wife and I both love a wide variety of music, but my wife tends to get frustrated by Alexa and does not use the unit very often.I liked my generation 2 so well that I bought one each for a couple of family members and another one for myself (it is a generation 3). I was going to buy a third unit for my in-home office, but after transferring the 2nd gen from my bedroom for my office, I realized I could not concentrate on my work for listening to the music.I've heard all the stories about how Alexa is spying on me, but I'm not terribly concerned. I watch a fair number of YouTube videos--anything that sparks my interest--and the 3rd gen unit is right next to the TV, so, if it's recording my info, it's getting a wide variety from sensible to weird information. Also, I like to play the TV while I'm away from home, just to confuse the would-be burglars, and I usually play it on one of the traditional news channels, because they talk a lot instead of showing movies, and that should confuse the wannabe burglars more. I tried using Alexa for that, but the unit stops playing after half a dozen songs (just estimating), but the TV will drone on and on until I turn it off. When some of my more suspicious friends or relatives visit, I unplug the unit so they can talk candidly, just to make them feel more comfortable. I have been known to remind them that their cell phones and TV sets do the same thing, even when you turn them off.I've learned to be very specific about the music I want to hear. I never tell Alexa to play a song without specifying the artist. If she still picks the wrong song or artist, I try to ask in a different way, but usually find out that the song I want to hear is on the $3.99 per month additional list, which I do not subscribe to. The unit is usually pretty good about substituting a channel that has music I like--based on the song I asked for. I'm impressed that AI is as smart as it is in this tiny unit.Sometimes, when I get bored, I like to ask Alexa stupid or confusing questions, just to see how it answers. Yeah, I'm easily entertained, but it's surprising what the unit can come up with. I get a lot of ""Sorry, I don't know that.""My brother and I were trying to fix a leaky faucet in my daughter's home when her Alexa unit in the other room spoke to us. At first we thought someone had come in without our knowing it. Since it was a female voice, we did not start looking for weapons to defend ourselves from burglars, but we quickly went to see who was there. The house was empty. I laughed when my brother suggested the house might be haunted, but it made me stop and think. Later, my daughter reminded me about the Alexa unit I had bought for her--yep, same voice. The point is, you never know what will set the unit off. You do not have to mention its name or speak to it.I've never had a problem with the unit waking me up in the middle of the night, but it does start blinking yellow when I have a notification. Took me a while to figure that out. I get notified about storms, kidnappings in my home state, when an Amazon package has arrived, and a few other miscellaneous messages. It never wakes me up, except for when I set an alarm, but I have to set the alarms individually. I cannot tell it to wake me up every weekday morning at 7 a.m. I have to set a separate alarm for every morning of every day I want awakened. But it also allows me to set other alarms. For instance, I can tell it to set an alarm for 5 p.m., so I don't work too long on my computer. If I'm cooking something, I can tell it to set an alarm for 15 minutes from now; otherwise, I will ruin my lunch and stink up my house, because I don't think about food until 3 or 4 p.m.  All in all, I highly recommend the units.","September 3, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R
"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have the third gen Echo dot and this is my first Amazon device.  I'm pretty much an Android / Google guy.  The price was right and I initially just wanted to listen to AM / FM radio stations that are on the internet, but I'm finding so many more useful features that Echo does as well.  This is one smart dame.  Set up was super easy from my Android smartphone and the Alexa app and with a marginal (fair) WiFi signal where I have the dot, it's been working fine with no dropped WiFi or long delays connecting to the internet radio stations.One thing I suggest you do after the basic set up is to open the app and go through the settings and CONFIGURE the device to suit you, as some of the default settings might not be how you want.  Enable some things and disable others, set custom time to start and stop things, like the do not disturb setting.  Mine is set to start at 8 PM and go off at 8 AM that way it will be sure never to wake me since it's in the bedroom with me.  Also check the privacy settings as you may want to change some of them as well.  Amazon did a pretty good job of allowing the end user to get it set up as you want,  but you need to spend a little time in the app.  Hard to beat at the price.

Or do I want to add an end of work day playlist, or constant reminders for things.I also move a lot and so every time I move I have to break it to her we no longer live in Arizona.  But still she persists that I must know the weather of Arizona.  Now that I adjusted it to the correct location, she has stopped telling me the weather.  How petty!I now got invis-align braces.

Its easy to get the weather and ask other questions of trivia and such. I enjoy most that I have a louder speaker for music now, it sounds alright but the more you turn it up it loses some of tone to the music. There is also a mute button on the device that turns the light red when pushed, so Alexa will not listen or accidentally start talking. The major thing I do not like about it is my family have different spotify accounts and in order for us each to listen on our own accounts you have to have two different amazon accounts and swap between them through Alexa.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Due to lack of good Wi-Fi for a while our home lacked the ability to use Alexa after we had been for quite some time, she was missed! Finally moved where the ISP could provide the Wi-Fi needed to have her again so not only using the existing Canister (1st Gen) and dots were able to add to them with the updated generation of dots an my family and I love the convenience. It's like hiring a personal assistant with a talent who can entertain us for around the house to help with everything from looking up information on the fly and adding things were out of to a shopping list we can access from our cellphones so we don't forget to replace what is needed when were out shopping to looking up recipes while were in the kitchen and we don't need to use up quite costly ink to print them out. We can set timers and reminders and even shop for things we are in need of or reorder things we've purchased in the past. Almost too good to call a personal assistant because you don't have to keep paying her to do the thing she will do for you past buying the initial unit chosen for your particular application. She also plays our favorite music and or even radio stations and so much more. Being 81 it's nice knowing if I need it I can even ask her to call for help if I can't reach a phone.Dots are great, no need for more than your Wi-Fi, a power outlet and of course your Prime Membership helps I'm sure. I have one in the car, on my cellphone, and in every room of my home including but not limited to one out on my patio where I garden and have my coffee and another out in my barn where I tinker around much of the time building things from wood.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",1.0 out of 5 stars,"We've only had our Alexa devices setup for about two weeks now, so we're definitely still working out the kinks. With that said, this is a review of everything I've noticed of our entire Alexa ecosystem, which includes 2x Echo Dots, 2x Echo Spots, 2x refurbished Echos, and 1x Echo Sub:Pros: Individually, they all work exactly as they should ALMOST all the time (more on that in the cons section). They all look good, and aren't big, ugly hunks of metal and plastic taking up space in your house. They were all incredibly easy to get through initial setup (except the Echo Sub, more below). Music sounds good in all of them, to include the Echo Dots (but it sounds GREAT on the Echos, and fantastic on the Echo/Sub pair).Cons: The voice recognition is almost too good for its own good. We have a fairly open floor plan, with an Echo Spot in the living room and an Echo in the kitchen. Sometimes they both hear a demand, and the wrong device (meaning the one farther away) will respond. I find myself occasionally whispering to an Echo device so its friends don't butt in to the convo.The Echo Sub needed to be reset 3x when I first got it/went to set it up. I had to log in/out of the app a couple times as well before it was recognized and would actually pair to an Echo.Sometimes Alexa tells me she can't complete a request, then my wife (who uses Alexa far less often than I do) will ask the same request and it works...and vice versa. We haven't figured out what we're doing/saying or not doing/not saying for these discrepancies to happen, but hopefully that'll work itself out with time.The most irritating issue I have so far is getting music to play on the ""Everywhere"" group. Sometimes I say ""Alexa play music everywhere"" and it just doesn't do it. Sometimes it'll play on only some of the devices, and sometimes it'll only play on the device I was speaking to. Our house is two stories, and we have two kids and a dog, so we spend a ridiculous amount of our time cleaning/walking up and down the stairs. A big part of the reason I bought these was for the music to fill the house while cleaning, and it oftentimes requires me to spend some time arguing with Alexa to get that to happen. It's even gotten to the point where I've had to go into the app and manually select ""Everywhere,"" because the voice command just won't work.Individual components:2x Echo Dots (w/ separately purchased wall mounts): No complaints. They setup just fine, and work perfectly. They're actually bigger than I thought they would be, and look a little clunky mounted to the wall, but overall they don't mess up our aesthetic enough for me to dock them a star or anything. 5/5 would recommend.2x Echo Spots: No complaints again. These were the first two devices we bought, and they worked so well I decided to buy the other devices. My favorite part of these is their ability to pull up security cam footage. My desk is in the basement, so it's nice to say ""Alexa show me the driveway"" and see who just pulled in, or to say ""Alexa show me the front door"" when the doorbell rings. I paired these will some web cam covers (also bought on Amazon, of course) so Jeffy and his crew can't record me all day long.2x refurbished Echos (in charcoal): I bought these to play music, and they sound amazing. We'll see how they hold up, given that they're refurbished equipment, but I have my fingers crossed. They also look great, and are not an eye sore like other speakers.1x Echo Sub: The only device that gave me an issue with the setup process. For that, I'd honestly give the Sub 4/5 stars because it really was a pain in the butt getting it properly hooked up. It gave me issues not just connecting to Wifi, but also when pairing with an Echo. Lots of logging in/out of the app, resetting the Sub. Irritating, to say the least. However, with that one star docked, I'd give it a SOLID 4/5 stars. This thing sounds GREAT. I'm a huge music lover, but hip hop/rap is really where my loyalty lies. And I NEED bass when I jam, and this thing delivers bass in spades. Even with the setup issue, I'm planning on buying another for in the basement. If Amazon ever makes a waterproof version, I'll buy one for outside for bbqs/parties too.","July 29, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R
"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Echo Dot itself is a nice little unit. It's compact, and if you don't need a screen or camera it works well for simple device control, weather reports and some uncomplicated questions. You can turn the microphone off if you don't want it listening to what you're up to, and it's wonderful for times and alarms. ""Alexa, 30 minute timer"" is all you need to say to get beeped in 30 minutes. I like that better than fussing with the timer on my stove. Timers, reminders and alarms (all different things) are probably what I use the most.Where I think it falls down is the AI aspects. I'm sure Amazon is proud of how well it does, and as a software engineer who has done a bit with natural language parsing, I recognize the challenges. But I was writing natural language analyzers in the 90's as a hobby, that did better than this. Simple example: you can ask for current weather almost anywhere in the world with a simple ""Alexa, what's the temperature in San Jose Costa Rica."" And bang, you get the temperature there. Oh, you want the humidity too? You try ""Alexa, what's the temperature and humidity in San Jose Costa Rica"" and it is instantly confused. Yet you can ask for the humidity separately and it can figure that out. Basically, asking for ""x and y"" instantly confuses it. That's just bad analysis; kids in grammar school used to be able to diagram sentences and Alexa should be able to as well. That's one example of many.Using Alexa for web searching is hit or miss, and more miss than hit. She has a few favorite websites she likes to look things up on and for some simple queries that works. But more often than not she comes up with an answer that's wildly unrelated to the question; these can be laughable moments, but it can also be annoying. She's no Watson. Don't buy it if your main hope is getting it to do web searches for you.If you have a few of these in the house, you can use them as intercoms, either point to point or to all devices in the house. ""Alexa, intercom, living room"" is all it takes. The microphones allow you to have conversations even if you're across the room from the Echo. You can also set them up to place calls using an iphone account, though you can't use it to pick up calls to your iphone.Randomly, she loses contact with the internet (and that makes her instantly useless) even when nothing else has connection problems. Power cycling fixes it. Just waiting doesn't seem to. It's rare but annoying.You will absolutely want to turn off the option for buying things via an Echo. It sometimes tries to make product suggestions and that's absolutely untenable. And while they did try to make it hard to order stuff by mistake, and you can set a security code so your children can't order candy by the metric ton, it's surely a matter of time before your kids eavesdrop and get the code. I know Amazon wants you to use Alexa as a ""shopping assistant"" but it's a foot in the door that you don't want open in the first place.One awful misfeature - Alexa sometimes tries to be cheery and positive. Occasionally she'll throw in stuff like ""Have a nice day!"" or some other meaningless drivel. I don't see an option to turn it off. I'm sorry, but Alexa is not and will never be a person, and having some algorithm wish me a good day is at best an insincere try at manipulation and at worst some sort of weird attempt to make you trust robots. It's flat out creepy. When I ask her to reporting something, I want a brief answer and then silence. If I want an actual conversation I'll talk to my wife, thanks.Sound quality is actually fairly good given the size, which is to say, not special. It's no audiophile device and using it play even background music is something I just don't do. It's fine for news stations on the web. If you want to ruin an early Pentatonix song, have Alexa play it. Ari's voice is simply out of range. And just forget most Classical.Summary: useful, yes. I might even say Very. Life-changing, not quite. And it could be so much better. Eventually maybe it will be; the language processing is done remotely and I'm sure there are improvements monthly. But as ""your plastic pal who's fun to be with"", or even a device with the language understanding of a four year old, it has a long way to go.","August 17, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me start by saying this was my second Echo Dot, and I have set up smart plugs - all a breeze.  This second Echo Dot not so much.  After taking almost an hour and a half trying to hook it up to my wifi going back and forth on my computer from page to page, looking up help on line/you tube I finally said I've had it - this thing is going back.  I put it back in the box and taped it up.  The next day I had a little remorse and thought I would try again and cancelled my return.  Well, same thing - nothing I did would make it connect to wifi.  During the return process online for a second time it asked if anything could be done to help and I thought what the heck and entered yes and for a phone call ""now"".  I no sooner hit that response and my phone was ringing.  I explained my frustration over the two days I've been trying to hook up this thing and she was happy to help.  The first thing she asked is what browser was I using.  I said I knew from looking on-line for anything that would solve my troubles that you could not use Google/Chrome so I was using Edge.  She said Edge won't work either - you can only use Firefox as the web browser to set it up.  As soon as I signed into that voila - everything worked quickly and all was well.  Why can't Amazon just say that in the insert with the product or in any of it's online instructions.  I didn't see this information anywhere - it should be in a big and bold font.  So... long story short, if you are going to use your computer rather than your phone to set up you Echo use FIrefox.  I did, of course, keep the Echo Dot and am now glad that I went the extra mile to get that silly thing connected.  This is the only reason I gave it a 4 rating.","May 18, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased multiple Blink items overall review-A real security system gives you at least 4 zones that can be adjusted and armed separately. It has an audible alarm, it may also have a cell phone connection. I have owned several such systems and had good service from them.Blink has none of these qualities.You can have ""zones"" but each will cost you $35 to $40 for a sync module so, 4 zones min $140 and you have nothing else. The cameras are not real motion detectors, as illumination does not set off motion detector like the blink cameras and doorbell do; hence multiple false alarms. If you use lights on timers  in the room with blink cameras they false alert each time a light turns on or off. Light control is a big part of security. Blink IR is very poor by today's standards.The Blink door bell has a sensitivity adjustment, but set to lowest setting it still alerts when a car goes down the street. It is 80' from my Blink doorbell to the edge of the road and it false alerts every time a vehicle goes in either direction.r I have mine on battery; you can hard wire it in place of your existing doorbell). Amazingly it alerts to cars but not to Amazon delivery people right in front of it. Yes it recorded 9 cars today (I live in a Cul-de-sac or I would have smashed the doorbell by now) but not the ghost that placed my Amazon package on the porch right in front of it.The Mini Cameras alert every time a light is turned on or off, but sometimes doesn't when I walk by.To use local storage instead of cloud you have to have at least one Sync module and an SD card. So if you have four zones as above example you add $10 to $20 per SD for each module which adds another $40 to $80 to your cost. Now all of your ""security recordings"" are on 4 different devices and totally separate. Does this sound like a security problem?The outdoor cameras are all three still in the box so I cannot tell what problems they will add. Too disappointed with Blink so far to waste time adding to my disappointment.The Echo Dot and Echo Show which Amazon recommended to go with the blink system are also still in the box so no info on problems they might have.I purchased all of this prior to Christmas in order to update and improve my 8 to 10 year old small security system. I do not use the Cloud for any security purpose so local storage was a must. Due to life in general, I did not have time to open and set everything up. When I finally got around to it, I became aware that the Mini's would work, but I had to purchase a Sync module to have local storage. Later found out that local only transfers videos to SD once a day and will NOT record Live View (yeah this is a security system LOL). You may notice that Blink does not tell you a lot of this in their description. For way less money I could have purchased a legitimate, real security system with 4, 6 or 8 zones and cameras with wifi and had something that I would trust and not hate. A friend suggested that I sell Blink on Craigslist. I told him the Blink system is bad: I would feel like a criminal asking money for it. It would make a good baby monitor using the Mini cameras, I guess.Amazon refuses to stand behind the Blink system since it is past their return date. I spoke with customer service and she transferred me to someone else for assistance with the Blink and they just hung up on me when I told them it was totally unsatisfactory.Buyer Beware. Just because Blink is owned by Amazon does not mean you will be pleased or they will stand behind it.I bought it, I didn't use it before return date so my fault for not doing my research. Now cut my loss and go to Costco and purchase a real functional security system.","March 15, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

I appreciate the fact that the microphone turns off although being somewhat of a conspiracy theorist, again, who knows? The access to my playlists is an enormous benefit. To say ""Alexa, play Playlist 1 from my music library"" and it happens? Fun stuff.Cons - I felt the pain of some reviewers when I excitedly hooked up my Dot for the first time but Alexa mumbled something about not understanding me. Contacting Amazon representatives for assistance is always hit or miss, even when being ""escalated."" I completely believe some customers fail to get any help at all - happened to me more than once. It's the luck of the draw and depends on how many hours of your life you want to spend on their products. I'm no expert but also no slouch with these issues. My installation start to finish was almost 3 hours. Crazy, crazy. A lot of people don't have the patience. It all began with the app store telling me I already had an Alexa app (my Fire) and refused to give me one on my phone.  After 3 Amazon rep Chats along with rising blood pressure and more than a little yelling (not at the reps), that situation resolved. I'm not sure if it was the last rep (who disconnected abruptly as they do) or the link (play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.dee.app). I couldn't have pulled that one out of thin air. Mission accomplished. At that point I though the Dot would fire up. Wrong. That's when the mumbling began. I contacted Audible (also Amazon reps) this time since I began with attempting to open an audiobook.  I might as well be on the other end giving advice, telling desperate customers to plug and replug the unit. Really? Representative 3 finally suggested I ask Alexa if there were any updates. Even though she said she couldn't understand me, she understood that request. In another short 20 - 30 minutes, Winnie the Pooh started up! The relief of it all! I've also experienced problems requesting Alexa to play individual songs that I have bought on Amazon. For a fact these songs are in my library and included on my playlists. She can't find them and wants me to buy Amazon Whatever service, listen to the song by a different artist, or listen to a station with similar music. Why? Why won't the thing just play my music that I've spent tons of money buying from Amazon? Following questions posed to another 3 representatives, it seems my requests cannot be phrased the same each time for specific songs. Who knew? Certain songs require finesse: 1) Stars from Les Miserables the movie - I can only hear my song I BOUGHT by saying ""Russell Crowe songs"" and potentially getting to Stars after various other songs I didn't buy. No matter what I say. 2) Come What May from Moulin Rouge movie soundtrack. I always get the Broadway version, which is fine but NOT WHAT I BOUGHT. Still working on that one. 3) Can't Help Falling in Love from Crazy Rich Asians - Alexa insists I say ""Crazy Rich Asians from my music library Can't Help Falling in Love."" Why can't I say ""Can't Help Falling in Love from Crazy Rich Asians in my music library"" or ""my music library Can't Help Falling in Love from Crazy Rich Asians""? It's enough to make you crazy.I hope these experiences will be helpful. All in all I enjoy the Dot. Buyer beware - Alexa doesn't necessarily make your life easier.","September 13, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hello fellow shoppers. I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen, because it was $5 with coupon and prime membership, and my mother wasn’t going to buy it so I decided to buy it and review it since she never reviews things.THINGS TO KNOW :Voice Recognition - she recognizes everybody’s voice. I even tried it in my manly voice, and this girl literally understood. I literally don’t know how to fix it, and I’ve been stressing. So in terms of voice recognition, I give this dot a 3 because she will literally pick up on anybody. I think she needs to learn a little from her frenemie, Siri.Integration - I have absolutely zero clue what this means. But it must be bad, because It’s coming from Alexa.Sound quality - Honestly, I wish it was clearer.  I’m glad you can lower it and raise it, but this… thing… she sounds a little hm, weird. It’s not bad though. You can also ask her to speak faster, or slower if you’d like. I’m trying to change the voice to a British man that way I look forward in talking to her, but it seems like I can’t. What a shame.General - It was quick to equip like my loadout in COD, (My COD username is lisettemaria btw), but the part that took me out was the Wifi part. This thing literally took roughly 6 minutes just to connect to Wifi. It’s probably because I’m stupid, but the instructions were pretty, hm, not descriptive enough.You may be asking, “Hey customer, shouldn’t you search it up?” But why you in my business like that, hm? When you’re like me, and you get your package, you wanna open it right away. You don’t want to wait to search this up.Also, Amazon has been stepping up it’s delivery game. I ordered this at 8 PM and it got here at 6 AM. Literally took like 10 hours, I don’t even know if that’s right. You do the math.But ohhh my gosh, I started playing Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader, and I got the answer wrong, so I clearly am not even though I am a high schooler. So what would any normal person do when they get something wrong on this stupid game? Leave. So I asked this thing to stop playing, and she kept going. And she kept mocking me saying “Wrong.” I asked again politely this time to stop and all she said was, “You both got the answer WRONG.” After 5 attempts, it finally turned off.Also you know what bothers me? When people copy me. And after I decided to buy this, my younger sister went on a frenzy and made a prime account to buy this. And guess what happens to people who mock me and all of a sudden decide to copy me? Their echo dot decides to go crazy and then she ends up struggling to connect all these things. So who does she ask? Me. I tried helping her, but she obviously doesn’t appreciate it And even as the older sibling, she tries to act like an adult. Anyways.Summary - She’s a good person, I also made her tell me custom goodnight messages. And to do this, just enable “Alexa Good Night” in skills. And I did this because I’m lonely and I have no friends. But yes, buy this if you just want a friend, or for you adults with jobs, or for those without ones too. BUY THIS","July 21, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've been an Echo user since the first tall Echo arrived. I've had many different gens of Dots including Gen 1, Gen 2 and even the Echo Input. This is the first Gen 3 I've owned. Hands down, this is the worst performing Dot I've ever owned. This Dot is also the single most buggy Dot I've ever owned.Sure, the CPU is faster, but that doesn't make this Dot any better. In fact, the faster CPU seems to cause problems for Alexa's speaking capabilities. Let's get started with this Dot's litany of problems.1) The faster CPU seems to cause Alexa to clip words and phrases, specifically when one phrase tails into the next. Alexa had always been good at adding proper pauses between sentences, but not on this Dot. The statements are so bunched up tightly, it sounds like a run-on sentence without any punctuation, usually clipping the last and first words.2) This Dot fails to announce upcoming calendar events randomly. Sometimes it announces, sometimes it doesn't. Nothing changes with the calendar event, yet the announce time comes and goes with not a peep out of Alexa.3) This Dot fails to participate in the competing request system almost entirely. I've never had this issue with any other earlier generation of Dot. When multiple Dots hear a request, the one that determines it is closest to the voice ""wins"" the election and answers the request. This 3rd Gen Dot answers surreptitiously every time, regardless of distance away from the Dot.4) As a follow-on to #3, sometimes, audio randomly begins playing from this 3rd Gen Dot even though another Dot answered the request. For example, if I ask, ""Alexa, play CNN"" to a 2nd Gen Dot. That 2nd Gen Dot responds with, ""Now playing CNN on Tune-In"", yet the audio begins playing from this 3rd Gen Dot. If the audio is to be diverted to another dot, Alexa should respond as, ""Now playing CNN on Tune-In on Living Room Dot"". It doesn't do this. The 3rd Gen Dot simply takes the audio without being requested.5) I've had the audio output entirely stop working. Asking Alexa to increase the volume doesn't help. The 3rd Gen echo simply stops producing audio. The request is accepted and completed, but no audio can be heard.6) The Echo Remote's Alexa button feature crashes the 3rd Gen dot. All other buttons work except this important feature. If you attempt to use the Echo Remote Alexa button, the 3rd Gen Dot initially tries to accept the request, then a slight flash of a red ring, then the entire Echo Dot crashes. Apparently, the Dot has a way to recover from this crash and does so 10-15 seconds later. It doesn't leave the Dot crashed forever, but this functionality of the Echo Remote fails to work on the 3rd Gen Dot. Note that this remote works 100% flawlessly when connected to a 2nd Gen Dot. Definitely a bug in the software. Worse, once the remote has been connected, then ""forgotten"", this Dot will randomly find and pair it on its own.7) Even though the microphones seem more sensitive (can hear at a greater distance) than earlier Dots, it actually ""hears"" the requests much more poorly. I've had to repeat myself way more often with this Dot than with any other Dot or Echo. The microphones are poor quality and apparently noisy.8) Resetting this 3rd Gen Dot by long pressing the action button does not forget all settings about this device. The device still ""remembers"" Bluetooth devices it formerly used, it remembers WiFi network passwords, it even remembers its previous name. Factory resetting a device should clear all knowledge of everything in the device. Clearly, more bugs.Bottom line, if you're considering a single Dot for your house and this is the one, it'll probably work fine. If you're a household that has already entrenched Gen 1 and Gen 2 devices that work well, you're likely to find the addition of a Gen 3 device to be a shock. This Dot functions and behaves almost entirely contrary to the rest of the Dots you may already have.One final note. Gen 1 and Gen 2 Dots and Echos are slated to be End of Lifed for security updates between 2022 and 2023, depending on when you bought them. This was not ""announced"" by Amazon. Instead, you must log into the Amazon site, then dig down into the settings area where your devices are registered. Here, you'll find when the security updates end for each device. Note that once the security updates end, the devices are likely to become the target of hackers... meaning, they should probably be retired from people's homes. That ultimately means replacing them to buy new versions with security updates. Amazon should have already proactively not only announced the End of Life program, but discussed the ramifications of losing security updates with these devices in people's homes.If all newer versions perform as poorly as this 3rd Gen Dot does, I'm not sure how much longer any Echo devices will remain viable for use in the home. Amazon needs to reconsider this End of Life policy for security updates on these devices. Amazon should have at least given consumers the option to pay to extend our security updates for several years longer. Additionally, Amazon needs to fix so many bugs in these units (see above). I honestly cannot recommend the purchase of a 3rd Gen Dot with the current number of bugs outstanding which Amazon seems intent on refusing to fix.","January 6, 2022",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought 2 dot 3rd gens to go with my dot 4th gen and 2 show 5's.  One of the 3rd gens is for the garage.  The other is for the back patio.  Now, because these aren't outdoor/weather proof, my plan was to install it underneath the eave of the house to protect it as much as possible.  Turns out that I don't have to do that because there's a portable battery/dock for the 3rd gen and you should definitely buy it if you're gonna buy one of these devices.  What I like about the 3rd gen is that it's simple.  I don't need a screen/camera for the garage or for the patio/entertaining.  What I need is music and the 3rd gen is plenty loud, has an adjustable equalizer (FYI, your options are Bass, Middle, and High from -6 to +6 and you just tell the thing which setting and what value... to be honest, it is a little bit ""tinny"" sounding but it is the older 3rd gen), and has access to all my music and skills I use on the fancier models I have around the place.  The other thing that I like about the whole Alexa system is the shopping list.  So if I'm in the garage or anywhere, really, and I run out of something or realize I need something I can just tell Alexa to add that item to the shopping list and then BANG, it's right there on my phone app when I get to the store!  To be honest that's about the only thing I use the devices for.  Now if I had to give it a con this is it.  And this con might be something I just don't know how to do... but you can't say something like, ""Alexa, play the Chiefs game,"" and expect it to find the game.  You have to know what station is broadcasting it and then tell the thing to play that station.  That's a real pain because sometimes I don't know the radio station because I like teams that aren't just my local home teams.  Anyway, that's about all I don't like about it.  Oh, and that it's not outdoor/weather proof.I didn't tell you this, but another feature I like about all this Alexa stuff is being able to have them all play the same music on all the devices so if you're entertaining or just piddling around and you go from room to room you don't miss a beat on the music.  And they're synched, too, so it's not annoying like 2 different tv's playing the same show but one is a little bit ahead of the other so the audio messes you up.I do know that the devices recognize my voice better than my wife's but that could be because 1) when my wife set up her voice on the machine she tried to speak properly and not the way she talks, 2) when she talks she's got a real ""she's from Texas"" accent, or 3) maybe Alexa just work well with the frequency of women's voices.  I'm not calling that a microaggression.  I'm just telling you about our experience.","July 6, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

The connection was easy as expected, but the sound is just okay. I know it's not as big as Alexa, but the sound could be better. It's too much 'treble' in it and some songs even sounded 'scratchy' because of it; I adjusted some audio settings, and the sound is a bit better, but I get about the same quality just from my phone! However, it will works for what I want, especially because I don't use it everyday, and when I play music, I can always group them and play it from both at once (Alexa and Echo). I did change its wake up word so that when I call one, both don't answer, and I disabled 'drop in' too, so just 2 settings you may want to change as well.","July 25, 2022",United States,B07FZ8S74R

My remote is also voice control so I don’t really deal like I need it). I can play my Apple Music which I like and the other list features are great. I have my alarms set and when I have a hard time sleeping I Alexa play the sound of the rain and it is automatically preset to play for an hour and that gets me to sleep every time.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Echo Dot 3 was easy to set up and get running. Let’s you take advantage of all the Alexa sound activated apps and features at a minuscule entry level cost. I ordered along with optional battery to enable portability. The only downside but understandable at this price level is the sound quality is not the greatest. However, part of this may be due to how the aux. battery attaches. It might be muffling the speaker/sound which would explain the “fishbowl or underwater” type of sound effect resulting in a muted basal sound lacking in tonal clarity/quality on the mid to higher freq. sounds. I have not yet tried connecting to an aux. speaker by wire or Bluetooth to see if that helps and hopefully it would. It is a pretty darn good value though for what you get and what it does.","July 23, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

I've also tried pairing it with my Xbox Series X but it only worked the first time. Every time I issue a command for it now the Echo just says the device is can't be found and may be offline, which is definitely not the case. So it's all a work in progress still for me.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've had my original dot for some time now and have since added a few more as well as a show. Overall the dot has outstanding voice recognition, though it can be a little spotty if there's too much ambient noise....trying to tell alexa to turn down the volume when you have the music up a bit is pretty much an exercise in futility 😂. Sound quality is about that of a decent bluetooth speaker, fairly decent range and bass response you would get from a 2.1 soundbar. It's by no means a replacement for an actual home stereo system but having multiple dots in different rooms all linked together gives a nice encompassing feel.You have to be careful with alexa, she's worse than siri and will pop up when you even get close to invoking her name....and sometimes even when you aren't even close to it 🤷‍♂️, I don't know how many times I've had to tell her to shut up because she just decided to drop her two cents in. The voice recognition is so good that sometimes she can hear me from another room, though the farther away you are the more likely you'll have to either repeat yourself or cancel an action she thought she heard.Integration is pretty decent, the Amazon library being open to all to use and create skills in. I have most of my home's electronics integrated with alexa now, from the TV to my cameras and even my thermostat. If you're unsure if you're devices will be support simply download the alexa app and browse the skills section, the only skill I'm missing is for my Viper Smart Start, unfortunately I don't think Viper will ever create that skill.Setup and use are straightforward and not at all difficult. Have the app downloaded and opened, be on your home's Wi-Fi, and plug in your alexa. Hit add alexa device in the app and you'll be up and running in a few minutes. Getting everything set the way you like it and discovering new features.....I'm a few years in and still finding things.","March 27, 2022",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I upgraded to this model from the Gen 2 model, back in 2020. I was hoping that the sound quality would've been much better than the Gen 2 model but it's worse. My hearing hasn't been great for the past several decades due to Tinnitus. No matter how much tweaking I've done with the settings, the speaker on the Dot has a very muffled bass sound that makes it almost impossible to understand. Turning up the volume helps a bit but it's not good enough.  As a workaround, I have it paired with a decent Bluetooth speaker with plenty of treble so it really helps. Not something I should've had to do but that's where I'm at today.One disadvantage of using the Bluetooth speaker is that Alexa will not work with the follow-up feature which is something I really liked. Another disadvantage is, for whatever reason, my reminders cannot be heard from the dot unless I crank up the volume.  The problem is when Alexa speaks on non-reminder-related questions etc., the volume will be painfully high. It's a lose, lose in my book.","October 6, 2022",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I will just start with my dislike- because there is only one, and there is a work around and that is clarity- I wish they would build an audio EQ managed by the App. I am hard of hearing and it's  muffled unless I turn the volume up, but it does have a output for an external powered speaker if that was the deal stopper. Now for the likes. I used to have the original version years ago and it require that a phone had to be within proximity and use wifi.  The problem being that if you left your phone in the car the DOT would not work at all, connectivity was compromised. This model is a great improvement, and I am using it for things I did not plan on. Originally I just wanted to have night time music, without using my iPhone and stressing the batteries. Now I just say: ""Alexa, play sleep music for 2 hrs."", and keep the volume at level 2"". It's is easy- I bought one for my wife which she keeps next to her desk, and if I want to talk to her or she want to wake me up she just says : ""Alexa, drop in on Jim Dot"" and viola- it's an intercom. I have a total of 4 in other areas of the house and You can broad cast an announcement you make up right there on the Dot, and you can have it broad cast immediately of what ever whenever you wish. You can music play on one or all , like I did during Christmas , with Christmas music everywhere. I haven't even mentioned the things I do with all my smart switches, such a lighting and devices like fans and home thermostat. If you have having to learn technical jargon, then this will make you happy it is very easy to use as I said before. Now if I has another improvement , that would be a few more Alias names. They have in the app. where you can rename Alexa to names like Computer, Zorro and a few more, I wish they had the name Alpha- maybe next version","January 7, 2022",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have recently added an Echo (3rd Gen. charcoal (2018)) Dot, an Echo (4th Gen. charcoal ((2020) Dot, two Echo (4th Gen. glacier white) Dots, and an Echo (4th Gen. glacier white) Dot with clock. I will be posting this same review for all of those. Some have remarked that they believe the 3rd generation dots have audio superior to the 4th generation ones. It seems to me the sound is better in the 4th generation units, however my hearing isn't great and the placement of the the 3rd generation one isn't very good (it's in the garage). I did discover that the sound quality and volume of the 4th generation one in a bathroom was significantly deeper and richer and noticeably louder when I moved it from being backed up against a single wall to being in a corner. It is on a stone vanity top at the corner of two sheetrock walls. These three hard surfaces seem to be acting like a megaphone for the audio - it sounds very good now. In all other respects there doesn't seem to be much difference in the performance or response of the four units except for the 4th generation with the clock almost seems bothered by me and intentionally ignoring it's wake word. I haven't determined if the difference is due to placement, it having to tell time as well, or the personality of the individual device; but it definitely seems to have an attitude. Some users have complained of the clock being too dim, but I find it to be ok - slightly brighter would be nicer, but no problem. They all seem to understand both my wife and me very well (and I've even used quite a few local expressions to speak to them with no problems). One complaint I have is that if I have the volume set for listening to pleasant listening music, Alexa's voice is too low to be easily understood. There should be different volume settings, and if there are already I haven't discovered how to handle that yet.","February 17, 2022",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Be careful adding alexa to phone contacts!  I ordered this device for my 88 year old mother so she could call us kids a little easier. It's pretty cool! You can add up to 10 alexa to phone contacts. More would be nice, but 10 was good enough. The problem is, nobody told me that you can only change them once. I added everyone from my phone and then said ""alexa call Jeff"" she said ""do you mean 4ice Jeff?"" Uh oh.... my brother is one of my in-case-of-emergency contacts.  That will confuse my mother. So I edited all of my siblings in my phone so they would make sense to mom. Deleted from the device and started putting them back in. Now I only have 8 contacts and it won't let me put the last two in. It says I've reached my 20 swap limit. I chatted with someone from Amazon and they said there is no work around. So now I'm stuck with a device that has 8 contacts that I probably won't use because of it was for me i would have started with our kids in it. It's no good for mom without all the kids. Good thing that was the $0.99 one! I did order another one but I will be very careful when adding the contacts.","September 10, 2022",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is the second review I'm writing for this product. I now have this Dot for over 6 months and I've been very pleased with its performance from the start and because it continues to function as it did the day I took it out of the box, I thought it deserves another recommendation. Amazon doesn't give me anything for writing good reviews so the only incentive I have to recommend a product is the performance the product itself gives me.  My reviews never vary at all from the truth. When I find a product that functions as it should or better, I believe that by saying it, I am helping others decide how to spend their money more wisely which ultimately helps them save money by buying good products instead of junk.  I have 2 other Dots, and two Echos with screens but this 3rd generation Dot is my best Alexa and really has exceeded all my expectations.  She detects my commands from further away than all the other Alexas I have , and transmits my requests to external blue tooth speakers effortlessly.  As a matter of fact if I am asking the echo I have in the kitchen for a recipe I have to whisper because if I speak normally my 3 generation Dot which is 3 rooms away, around a corner at the far end of the third room (over 60 to 70 feet away) will pick up the command along with the Echo in the kitchen.  My other Alexas have some issues every once in a while, but this Dot never even ever stumbled on a word I didn't pronounce perfectly.  It also has a fabric outer shell which makes it feel more substantial a product than the other models.  I am really very happy with this product and would buy it again and again.  Amazon, please don't try to make this one better than it is because it's already much better than ""good enough"".  ""Good enough"" is the label I give to products that are not bad enough to return but not good enough to want to keep forever.  I want to keep this Dot forever.  Great job Amazon but remember this  ""If it's not broken don't fix it"" and this Dot has never even come close to being broken.  Another helpful thought is that Amazon's voice recognition technology is fantastic especially when it's combined with Amazon Music Unlimited; in that case it recognizes the title of every song I ask it to play and many times will play the song I want to hear even if I only give Alexa the first verse of the song because I forgot the exact title.  Thanks Amazon, great job, keep up what you are doing.  While other companies are constantly looking for ways to cut costs and they cut costs by taking something out of the products they make Amazon seems to be making their showcase products better and better.  *""Look around you all you see is sympathetic lies""; smaller boxes of cereal, thinner cords on appliances, features that used to be are now gone to make the products cheaper, buttons and dials that have been taken away and cheap where ever cheap can get away with replacing what is better.  I don't see this happening with the products Amazon introduces as their own to the market.  Amazon's showcase products just keep getting better not less functional and not made cheaper.","January 7, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well I'm still learning and I guess so is the echo/alexa. I do like the voice recognition on it quite a bit  I had one friend who had to have cried 15 times to get it to respond or react to his voice and it just wouldn't work every time I open my mouth it reacted  corsets with something that we've both learned how to do already which was I believe turning on my TV at the time or turning it off. I wish it would know a few other things right off the bat. I was impressed that after I installed a light that was supposed to be able to be controlled by either the echo or my phone or whatever that after I couldn't find the correct learning thing in the app it actually seems to have picked up well I was trying to figure out how to teach it to do it. Does one night when I was asking it to do something I believe turning on or to turn something else off it asked if I would like the basement lights shut off. I needed lessons to learn how to teach it how to do almost. Anything and I hear alot of ""i don't know if I know how to do that"" or ""I dont know if i can do that"". Sometimes I see something online or In the instructions for a product that it can be connected to Alexa or controlled by Alexa it tells you that go into the app and you'll find it under you learning or something like that. So I go into the app and I do what it says and it doesn't seem to have the option that I'm looking for. Sometimes I'll wind up finding the option later often when I'm looking for something entirely different but or in a different section. I have got it set up so it will turn on and off my television though you have to be very specific with it. I can also get it to a play music from my phone through either it or the speakers that connected to my television though it often will not play the music I actually wanted to because it insist on only playing from one platform most of the time. Since it's not one I really use it gets a little bit aggravating especially when you have to spread out the instructions to about 25 words to get it to do one little thing. Other things it learned quickly and simply and haven't had a problem with it since the very first time I figured out the instructions to give it. Just like with my music there's some apps that I've loaded on my TV that it just refuses to go to or doesn't seem to be able to open and then attempts to find it under another option and tries to make me pay for a platform when I already have the same TV movie through another platform that I already paid for. I'm hoping I can figure out a few of the other instructions for it as we both keep learning. Or I can get it to open what I want it to or play from what I wanted to as I go along.","March 7, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The echo dot 3rd gen is the perfect size and shape for our use. We have two rooms that have outlets higher up on the walls so we bought wall mount kits. It's great because they're at a perfect level to be able to hear our voice commands and play music and not take up space on a shelf, table, desk, or counter top. We use these to listen to music in the bathroom and laundry room mounted to the wall. In other rooms we have them on the desk, fridge, bookcase, and entertainment center/TV stand. We use Alexa to control our smart home devices and the echo devices make it really easy to add voice control to every room in the house! We're all in with Alexa, even have it in our cars! We have issues with it understanding us sometimes but that's a learning curve. The sound quality is better than the 2nd generation and if you can setup 2 in one room the stereo pairing makes really good sound quality especially if you add the subwoofer which I plan to get next. If you're looking for good sound, voice control for your smarthome, easy and quick answers to questions, than this is a great, affordable, easy to setup option! We love how easy it was to setup and add devices and set automatic routines. Buying the echo dot alone will not control your smart home, it will just add voice control to a room, you'll need a bigger echo device to actually connect to all your devices and the Alexa app on your phone.","April 22, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a couple of these on sale a few years ago. I only have ever used one - the other has remained unopened in the box.I live with my grandfather who has dementia, and it has proven to be quite useful for giving him daily reminders for things like taking his medication and staying hydrated, as well as being a source of entertainment for him when he wants to listen to music. It's nice to know that he has that to at least remind him of important things throughout the day and I don't have to always be there to help him should he want to check what the day's date is or should he have some other question.My brother who has difficulty communicating visits us every week, and we have set up a sound board that he can use to activate the Echo Dot and effectively listen to what he wants to without having to rely on someone else - that's hugely awesome.Our home is always entertaining with the Echo Dot sitting in the middle of our house - and it's calm at night thanks to having scheduled ocean waves to play every night.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is awesome. If you can get past the idea of something listening at all times (I'll admit it is an odd thing) this is so cool to have for so cheap.Very rarely has it ever misunderstood us or not known what to do. Any music/channel available on Amazon Music can just be asked to play and it will. Pandora account channels can also be played from. The sound quality is better than literally ANY bluetooth speaker you can get for this cheap (yes it is also a bluetooth speaker).Alexa is pretty sweet to have in your house. The Dot will have a yellow ring on it for notifications so when you notice you just say ""Alexa play notifications"" and they can be anything from Amazon Shopping stuff to you or any friend setting up a notification for you. When I need to remember something I just say something like ""Alexa remind me to bring in the garbage cans in 30 minutes"" and it will beep, say it, and show a notification on your phone.People in the house, or even away from the house, can call in to the dot, or dots in other rooms can act like an intercom to other dots.I also did some smart home automation. It came with the outlet, and I added a DC switch, water main valve servo, and flood sensor. My water main will shutoff if there is a flood, and I can just tell Alexa to turn the Christmas tree on/off. There are skills for Alexa that listen for break-ins and also ones that make it seem like you are home with sounds, talking, and turning things off/on randomly.If you want the smart home features make sure that whatever service the device you get uses has an Alexa Skill to link it up. If something says it needs a hub and doesnt mention direct Alexa connection DO NOT get that if you dont have that hub. I have a few things and just to give an example they use Kasa, eWeLink, and Smart Home which Alexa can link to those accounts and control them. What this means is you will have accounts for each of those apps and Alexa will go through the internet to control those with their accounts. (That is my understanding, so no control with no internet).I took a star off of Alexa Integration, because even though my devices show in the device list, they do not show in the create routine menu (place to make a series of things happen). I worked around this so far since the smart home apps usually have their own routine makers. This could be a deal breaker if you get the wrong devices as Alexa would be the only common account to try and utilize the devices in series, but it can't. (Maybe I just dont know how to fix it, but it isnt hurting me for now). Another workaround would be IFTTT (If This Then That) is a service (somewhat complicated to figure out) that allows linking various accounts and making routines. This is somewhat hit or miss though as companies need to pay for support and some may only check device statuses like once every 30min to save money.","December 26, 2019",United States,B07FZ8S74R

It was a special for ppl who had never tried one so I figured I would just regift it if it wasn't for me.  I now own 3. I know I am behing when it comes to technology and all the new services that are out there. I'm obviously still a newbie and I know that I have a lot to learn but this little baby has helped me become more organized as well as less forgetful.(Well, it reminds me so I don't seem as forgetful🙃) I know I have a lot to learn but this little helper has given me more than enough reasons to actually change my routines and how they are managed. I'm a single mom that works full time so it's been a lifesaver for me. I wish I would've gotten one sooner. I am still learning all of the features and I think there are Eben newer ones now but I'm going to try to master this one first. Remember: Not a tech wiz.So to sum it up, if you don't have one and are like me and don't know much about items like this definitely give it a try. Apologies for the rant.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I got one originally back in 2019-ish as a gift and I liked it and now that I moved to a bigger house, I bought a second one a couple months ago while they were on sale for Christmas. I don't think I would recommend them at full price but for $20 or less these are honestly perfect! They are not perfect by any means but for a cheap speaker/alexa they are pretty good! They are a little glitchy when using music apps other than Amazon Music (I use Spotify). They love to randomly disconnect especially since I have them set up to play at the same time so I can hear my music no matter where I am in the house (one floor 1100sqft). So I keep one on each end of the house. Randomly one of the speakers (doesn't matter if it's the new or the old one) will disconnect/simply stop playing the music. It causes me to have to stop playing the music and hard reset the echo dot. It's pretty annoying but for the price point I live with it. But I have noticed it happens most with the older echo but does still happen with the new one. Hopefully they fixed this in the most recent gen.Pros:-Cheap-Decent sound quality-Allows ""Sidewalk"" which allows it to detect and share Tile tracker locations with their owner (Also asks if you want it to be activated or not so if you don't want it on you don't have to)Cons:-Randomly disconnect from the music playing-Occasionally gets static-y sounding-Each speaker will be off by a second or so, so if you have it set to be speakers near each other, you will notice it but when they are opposite sides of the house, you don't","February 16, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"So I actually got this with a promotion from SiriusXM, you get them XM service in your vehicle, phones,tablets, whatever, and all for $60 for the year included a code to buy the echo dot. Well my XM radio had been off a couple  of months, and even though  I have over 4000 MP3's on my phone, my car would  not let it connect to the infotainment system, which I later found a hack, but this little device, I have in the living room, and it's like having another phone or tablet but it's a speaker I stead, it does need to be connected thru your phone Initially then your home wifi, but its great,  I set reminders, set alarms, can have my alarm wake me up to my favorite  SiriusXM station. I can also connect the echo dot thru Bluetooth,  to my stero system at home, I listen to a lot of music so i use it long lot for that but I can also make phone calls, or be in another room and speak to my wife thru the dot on my phone, yeah I could  call her, but i just open Alexa app, drop in and say whatever  I need. It beats yelling throughout  the house. It has decent sound for as small as it is and again you can't beat the price, actually  I got premium satellite radio and the dot for free, or both for $60 for the entire year. SiriusXM is usually around $20 a month. I use the dot for information  non stop, amy question I have about something I ask and it tells me, I can make Amazon purchases by voice while doing something else, you can get recipes while cooking , pretty much anything you can think of, it also can connect to any smart device in your home, like lights, TV, thermostat,  etc, you can set routines so the light comes on every night when you get home from work,  set it once and it's done, there is simply to much  to list, I see ppl saying  there's comes on in the middle of the night or is activated by the TV or just conversation without say the word to turn it on, I've never had that problem, I'm probably  going to order a few more to put in other rooms and getting the newest one or with a screen for my parents  who are getting  older, just so they can play with it and control the fire stick as well.","July 19, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay so I'm debating between 4-5 stars but will go with 5 because the price is fantastic even as a speaker alone!!! Alexa is a lot of fun and more so then siri or bixbi and the speaker is great. I think it's a little better then my Anker Blutooth speaker I paid more money for so yes I'd say it's definitely worth it. It fills our living room with music.  I can ask alexa to play Christmas music and she will.. I previously was using spotiify through my phone and bluetooth which was more time consumung and made my phone slower and often there was connection issues with the spotify app. I was so tired of it and practically stopped listening to music.. Alexa interacts with me, answers questions and is all around so great to have. I have not used ""home"" features yet but you can also connect her to your compatible TV and Roku and she will change the volume, etc. Very neat!!! You can also play trivia with alexa but she is very limited and if you want more decks of trivia you have to pay for it which is a con for me.  Another good feature is she will also add items to your amazon cart and or you can choose to ""buy it now"" or repurchase items and will also look up items for you if asked.. So why am I debating between 4-5 stars? Well sometimes Alexa  doesn't know everything I need to know.. She can play news if asked or the weather and other simple commands and she does it better then bixby which is far behind however she often does not understand certain questions or only gives part of the answer. I can ask how to rebuild an engine for example (for fun ;) and she will give a simpliefied example but hey what can you expect. When she doesn't understand, you can rephrase and she usually understands. She also makes jokes if asked and can truly interact with you which is VERY neat. Bixby can do some interacting too but is definitely more limited making Alexa much much better although I think Alexa has room to improve her skills and knowledge.. That being said for the price of Alexa she is definitely worth it. The speaker plays music loud and clear and she will turn up and down the volume if asked. The only slight muffled sound that I read mentioned in reviews is Alexa's voice seems slightly muffled but I guess it depends where the device is set up.. Anyway the initial set up.litterally took minutes.. You need to download the Alexa app and go from there to connect your device via wifi but she was up and running in minutes!! Super easy set up even for someone not tech savy. I will definitely be getting another one for the Living room as I've been carrying the device room to room as it plugs in the wall and is inconvenient to carry room to room.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Okay so first off I'd like to say that I had a gen 1 echo for a few years now and it finally burnt out and I missed it so I purchased this gen 3 thinking it was going to be the same quality as the echo one, I was completely wrong the weight of this device is a lot more than the old echo device the size of it is a little bit bigger in diameter and has a much much better speaker in it. I was amazed at the quality of the audio that came out of that little device almost comprable to Bose integration is exactly the same as the Gen 1 and Gen 2 it's very easy as long as you follow the directions the power cord I noticed is alot beefier for this one I would say it's almost double the size of the old one. How this differs is this is an actual circular power plug that being said you cannot hook this up to any USB device to power it like you could with the gen ones this does have a small quarter inch headphone jack to allow you to put speakers externally to it. I did notice this is much louder than the old generation 1 echoes and much clearer. And with Amazon offering them for around $25 I'm just going to say you're a fool if you don't purchase one they even make set up very easy if you choose to have them add it to your existing account. That being said all you have to do is connected to Wi-Fi and you're done. I would recommend purchasing the smart lights and smart outlets to use with this that's how I found the most use out of this device and I've been using this for years you can literally connect almost any smart device to the echo so that it can be voice controlled. I currently use this for lights in my house as well as outlets plus I have it control outdoor Christmas lights on a timer which is also hooked up to music through prime music that being said there is just an amazing amount of uses for this product and it seems like they just keep getting better and better and better. Because they invented this voice control I guess you could say I would stick with them over Google or any of the other companies that may provide these devices I have never been a huge Amazon fan but they have actually done something fantastic with these devices. I think at least every home should have at least one of them. And if privacy is your main concern don't worry laws are in place that prevent the company from snooping in on your private data.Amazon really doesn't want a billion dollar class action lawsuit on them so they take this seriously. I purchased one for my wife and will probably be purchasing a few more to send to my kids so they can enjoy the device as I have enjoyed it","December 14, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R
"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've used other AI and home automation technologies and I am by far most impressed with Alexa. It works consistently and offers a wide range of features and functionality.A solid benchmark for such technologies is the manner in which it makes life easier and reduces or eliminates the need for other devices, technology, or action - Alexa does this well on all counts. The more I use it and get to know what it's capable of, I find that I'm phasing out other devices.One of the really nice features is the manner in which Alexa informs you of its capabilities - it does so gradually over time and in a non-obtrusive, but helpful manner. Overall the voice and sound quality is good, but I do notice the ""tinty"" AI voice surface when it says my name, which is a slight area for improvement.My only regret is that I didn't try Alexa earlier!","May 27, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The voice recognition is pretty good as it learned my son's speech quickly and he has a pretty severe speech delay/impediment and can be very hard to understand if you don't know him, so I was very impressed with that! I was concerned he would be disappointed that Alexa didn't understand him so it has been nice to see him happy when he's understood!Only real complaint is that I use my PC for most of my streaming entertainment and sometimes I want to listen to it while I'm cooking or getting ready in the morning so I thought these would be nice to have as small Bluetooth speakers in those rooms.  The problem is that once I connected the PC to them ONCE (which was a much bigger ordeal than any other speakers I have and it takes the echo forevvvver to find and connect, including telling me it couldn't connect and to try again before pausing for a minute then being connected anyway while I'm in the middle of trying to see if it's an issue with my PC Lol So a little annoying and slow to hook up to)... But yeah once I connected to them ONCE they auto connect (BOTH speakers) as soon as I turn my PC on, even if they weren't the last device I was hooked up to.  So I had to open settings and manually disconnect them every time i turned on my PC.So I just removed them from my PC because that was so annoying for how rarely I wanted to use them for that... But now I face a 10 minute ordeal dealing w my PC and the Alexa app AND the device to hook them up again when I want to use them quickly, so it's not worth the time and I just haven't used them at all for months.But if you have Alexa integrated smart lights or other devices they are definitely handy for that... Just really do NOT recommend them if you intend to primarily use them as Bluetooth speakers for music or podcasts or ESPECIALLY for your PC 😂","November 10, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly, I did not plan to use Alexa or buy a smart speaker, partly because my wife is opposed to them for privacy reasons. But over the holidays this unit, which was released in 2018 and has now been superseded, was selling for $20 including a smart lightbulb -- and with a $10 credit burning a hole in my pocket, I couldn't resist. Because of the aforementioned opposition I've set it up in my workshop.The device was incredibly easy to install -- basically, just plug it in and enable the Alexa account on the Amazon website. You can start asking it for things right away -- like playing a song you like. Since my family is not embracing the Alexa ecosystem, my use of it is limited, but it seems to do well the things I ask it for. I am amazed at all the skills that have been developed for it, though I haven't tried them other than the basic ones.The device sits quietly on a shelf until I talk to it, and then it seems to understand me reasonably well. Sometimes I have to rephrase things a different way to get it to understand. When music I request is not in its library, it doesn't tell me that -- instead, it picks something else that sounds like what I requested, which is kind of annoying. It does understand the word ""STOP""! But overall I think it's worth the small annoyances.The sound quality is not very good, but it's good enough in my workshop with the other ambient noise, and I really had no expectation of good sound with a device this small.So overall I like the device. Given my limited expected use, would I have purchased it at a significantly higher price? Probably not...","January 12, 2022",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my echo dot. I got mine 2 weeks ago on promotion for $1, as long as I subscribed to Amazon Music, which is only $8 as I’m a Prime member. All together the price came out to a total just over $10 w. taxes and was my greatest investment by far. I just hope I have unlimited warranty :D Only thing I don’t like is that sometimes I’m in the middle of playing games and it exits out on it own without my consent. for example there’s a game called Akinator and she will be in the middle of asking me questions and will not complete the game before she says “Do you want to start a new game?” Other than that everything is great. I love that I can manually control it from the Alexa app as well and not just by voice. Haven’t tried to connect it to another speaker via Auxiliary Cord but im excited to. I also look forward to investing in other Alexa devices to modernize my home. Thank you, Amazon.","April 28, 2022",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Surprised by the punch this lil guy has and by what it can do. Good at recognizing multiple voices and with the Alexa app it seems to seamlessly connect to any device I would want it to including the hifi Bluetooth system and a pretty used 2nd gen fire tv stick that I had. Alexa is pretty good at opening YouTube on it and playing whatever video I tell her to play. Since Amazon has their own music service, which I have with Prime, I didn’t think I would be able to link my Tidal account to it as well, but I could and they made it easy. The latest discover is with this $15 Sylvania Smart Led light bulb I bought the other night when I was out. It looks like a regular led light bulb and screws in anywhere but is full color and tunable. I just went out looking for a light I could change the color with using an app on my phone and found that it also easily connects to Alexa. Right now it’s named “First Light” because that’s the default name but it can be changed. Now I can say “Alexa, turn First Light Blue” and it’ll turn blue pretty smoothly. I can say Alexa, dim First Light” or Alexa, make First Light darker” and it’ll dim it but keep it the same color. Will also keep it the same color as it is if I tell her to make it brighter. Telling her to make First Light normal will get you the same result as telling her to make It white also it seems. Better at responding to make it normal with other noise in room though. The device actually surpassed my expectations. At the price its free.","December 30, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Before reading this review, please note that I base my reviews and ratings on COST as well as QUALITY & FEATURES. It is my way of offer fair and honest reviews that benefit other potential buyers, as cost should be considered. After all, it is extremely unfair to rate an item that cost $50 based on the features and quality of one that costs $500.As it relates to the Echo Dot (3rd Gen), for the current price, it is an absolute great deal.PROS:1. It's compact and can be placed relatively anywhere. There are even accessories that can be added to it that allow you to use your wall socket to hold the Echo Dot if you aren't interested in setting it on a surface.2. The 3rd Gen version has noticeably improved sound quality and improved voice recognition capabilities over the previous versions.3. There are NO MONTHLY FEES. Use of the Echo and most of the standard features are completely free. There are some paid subscription options that, for me, are worth it, such as Amazon Music and iCamera, however, even these features come with free options.4. I've always the computer system on Star Trek, and I've often imagine what it would feel like to have a similar system in my own home. With my Echos, I no longer have to wonder. They offer me the ability to control nearly every electrical devise in my home. I use my Echos to turn on and off the lights, to power on and off my television, surround sound, video game system and to adjust my thermostat. I also use it to control my Alexa enabled Microwave.5. In addition to using my Echos to play music and control smart devices, I use them as a Personal Assistant. The Echos make it easier than ever to schedule appointments and meetings. They are also great for setting reminders and To Do lists. And of course, I use them when cooking to set Cooking Timers that include labels for the food that I'm cooking. For example, if I need a timer for a Baked Potato, I'll tell Alexa to set a 45 minute Baked Potato timer. The Echo will then set a timer called ""Baked Potato."" This really comes in handy when you are cooking multiple things and need to set more than one time.6. In addition to what the Echos can do out the box, there are Skills, which work like mobile phone apps, that can be added to your Echo to increase its functionality. In the near future I'll post of list of some my favorites.Photos coming soon.","October 30, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I moved recently and had to abandon my stereo setup. That left me in a new apartment with no good way of listening to music. I'm in headphones all day and I hate playing music through the TV. I spent a few days looking for an affordable bluetooth speaker and, after reading reviews about the much improved Dot's audio quality, I decided to test it out.On the pro side of things, she's a fun little gadget. I like that I can tell her to guard my house, play trivia, get weather and news updates, and hear bad dad jokes. Often I'll ask her things just like I would another person, and I'm surprised at the answers I get. My favorite experience so far was asking her what I could make with a few cocktail ingredients I had on hand and she came up with recipes that she sent straight to my phone. She can read them off to you too, if you ask her to.She also hears me really well no matter where in my (2 bedroom) apartment I am. Rarely do I have to raise my voice much louder than speaking volume and I haven't had too many miscommunication issues. So as a hands-free virtual assistant, she's pretty versatile and great. Probably worth every penny I paid (I bought my Echo on sale). As a music device, I merely got what I needed.The sound quality is... okay at best. It's pretty much what you should probably expect from a tiny plastic disc. It's worst when you're right up next to the device. It starts to sound a little better as you move away from it. So having the dot on the desk next to you as you work probably isn't the best solution for great sound.That said, the volume is enough that it fills my apartment and I can hear it no matter where I am. That certainly fulfills one of my needs. If I need to listen to something while doing dishes or puttering about the apartment, I don't need audiophile quality because I'm not paying that kind of attention anyway. I just want something to keep me occupied/distracted. She's perfect for that. I like that I can request music and she'll play off either Amazon music or Spotify, so there's almost no chance I'll stump her with something. The other day I grossly mispronounced Hante, and she still understood what I was looking for. I can control the volume with voice commands also, which is great.More refined navigation can be done from inside the Alexa and Spotify apps, which is good for me since I rarely want to hear a shuffled mix.If I'm honest, this probably is the best speaker solution at this price point. I can't imagine getting features like this on another bluetooth speaker for the same money. Even if it doesn't sound like a good pair of bookshelf speakers, it's still a vast improvement over my phone in a cup AND she tells dad jokes. I'm looking forward to upgrading to the Amazon Studio when finances permit, but in the meantime the Dot does the job(s) I need it to.","December 20, 2019",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I really fought getting one of these in my home. What with all the horror stories about AI taking over the world and my privacy being grabbed by them on these devices. I mean they are always on, right?But I was given one for Christmas and I “had to use it “ or really offend a dear family friend. So I jumped in with my eyes wide open…I have been so very pleased with the integration among my phone, Alexa, and my car. As well as being able to use THEM(I now have 3) like intercoms.The voice recognition is spotty if your wifi signal  gets weak which can be annoying, and you do have to make extra sure to always register them with only ONE USER NAME AND EMAIL. AMAZON won’t tell you that. I found that out by trying to keep my new units separate since they were in different rooms and they wouldn’t talk to me or each other until AMAZON reset them and I had to start from zero on all my likes and favorites. It was a real bummer!The sound quality it great. It’s wonderful to be able to take phone calls via the dots. And still be able to surf on my phone.So over all we are very glad we jumped!","February 14, 2022",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"We already have a regular echo in our main living area and now decided to get three more for the two bedrooms and an office we use most in the house so there's always an Alexa nearby we can talk to. The Echo Dot is really convenient and fun if you take the time to learn about how it works and what it can do.I use it in my home recording studio to control the outlets on a power strip, an LED light strip, and another mood light I have in the room. It's nice to be able to control each smart appliance individually or all at once by saying things like ""turn the office off"" when I'm leaving the room for the night. We have another in my daughter's room that we use to control her closet light and a lamp. She's a year old so we tell Alexa to turn her lamp on a dim setting when she first wakes up in the morning or after a nap so she can adjust to the light. We also have another smart light in that room that changes colors and my daughter loves it.I have satellite radio in my car and only really get to listen to it while driving but with the Echo I can use the Sirius XM integration to play any of my favorite satellite radio stations all around the house. It's very convenient.Alexa isn't that great as far as digital assistants go. She isn't nearly as funny as Siri or the Google lady and is only really good for asking when actors were born or died. The rest of the time she just doesn't know or doesn't understand you and then goes off for an hour asking if you'd like to ask her about something totally different which gets annoying.Definitely do the voice training and remember that a single Echo can switch between multiple accounts. My wife never switches to her account so Alexa always has trouble recognizing when she's talking to her. She occasionally doesn't realize I'm talking to her or doesn't understand what I'm saying but for the most part she listens fine and can hear me from across the room without screaming. I turned on whisper mode so that when I'm in my office which shares a wall with my daughter's room, I can whisper to Alexa to turn things on or off and she will make a quiet blip sound instead of responding to me at full volume. It's a nice feature.The fact that the audio quality is only good for casually listening to music in the background combined with her seeming inability to learn more than one voice and not knowing the answers to most questions I ask are the reasons I knocked off a star. But overall this is a cool and useful toy if you learn how to use it. It's only become truly useful to my family since we started getting smart lights, smart plugs, and smart thermostats.","January 28, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"As an off-the-shelf product, Alexa isn't much better or worse than, say, Siri. You can ask about the time, the weather, play music, set a timer and all the basic voice assistant tasks. Easy to understand why someone wouldn't be impressed.The value of an Echo comes in when you put some time into setting up routines, linking Spotify and calendars, adding skill blueprints and so on. Unless you're the kind of person who enjoys optimizing (I am), you might not want to invest that much time. But now I have a fun and effective home assistant that can turn on the lights when I dismiss my alarm, let me know the weather, traffic to work and events on my calendar for the day, and remind me what I need to do before I leave -- then cue some music while I do it.I can see the appeal of a Show or other screened Alexa device -- showing shopping lists, task lists, recipes, etc. -- but I don't think there's enough of a value-add to justify the cost. Most of those tasks can be served equally well by the Alexa App on your phone.As a speaker, the third generation Echo Dot offers all the sound quality you need unless you're a major audiophile. Even its lowest settings can be a little too loud at times, which is why it's essential to know how to activate whisper mode in the mornings.Voice recognition is solid, although Alexa still misreads cues sometimes. I had to change my routine cue ""I'm up"" to ""good morning"" because Alexa misread it as ""What's up"" and gave me a news briefing. Won't pass the Turing Test any time soon!One comment I often get from friends and family is that ""Amazon is recording everything you say -- they did a news article on that!"" Security concerns come with any voice assistant, obviously. If you work under high security clearance, I wouldn't recommend a Dot.But for the average consumer, it's pretty easy to 1.) turn off the microphone manually using the button on top of the Dot, which 100% ensures nothing you say will be heard, uploaded, recorded until you turn it back on, b.) access and delete your entire Alexa voice request history online whenever you want -- I have a reminder set to do this periodically, or c.) just ask Alexa to forget everything you've said. Some people report problems with Alexa misreading ordinary conversation as a wake word -- this hasn't happened in my experience.I do wish Amazon gave us more freedom with routines, skills and blueprints. I'd much prefer to make my own blueprint or build a skill from the ground up. It seems like Alexa is capable of it. Even something as simple as [wake word, cue phrase] [then: cued response] [if:yes, then: response a] [if:no, then: response b] and so on would be nice. The inability to create long routines or built-in timers is occasionally frustrating.TLDR: Good speaker, mixed voice recognition, good functionality when you put the work in.","January 11, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"After adding a couple smart devices, it only seemed right to add voice control to it all.. For the basics, it is great.. Turn lights/devices on/off; it's pretty straight forward.. When adding rooms though it can get a bit illogical. Like most, the first time around, one might be inclined to add all the devices in a room to the room in the app. I have old analog radio's and other devices  on simple on/off smart plugs.. Walking into the room and saying ""wake word.. turn on the room""... is jolting when EVERYTHING turns on.. be selective what is added to a 'room' in the app. The naming convention, reminds me of old 90's programming. In this case, like most people, walk into a room and we'd say ""turn on the tv"".. not so.. each tv HAS to have a name even if in a/assigned room.. the same is true for game consoles, bath fans and other items that some families have multiple units of these days.. I can only imagine if there are multiple smart showers/baths!  On occasions my echo's get unassigned from their room, rendering the 'turn on the lights' useless and the drawn out ""there are no devices or groups with the name light or lights"".. When it comes to connection problems Alexa hasn't been taught to be brief, whether it's the 5th time or 500th time You've had a problem it still gives the same long winded response. This week saw AWS 'Amazon Web Services' go down in spectacular fashion for hours.. and the Alexa's responded by indicating it was a problem with the various manufacturers 'skills', and music/books & shipping updates were offline.. The house was completely at Amazon's mercy.. something I imagined could happen but wished never did.. It would be nice if Amazon would make a local mode for at least device control.. Luckily the 3 main manufacturers apps were handy to control the house.  I recently had to reset a echo device because it somehow became unassigned from its room, now absolutely none of my previously connected blutooth speaker will be found or connected to. I really enjoyed sitting on the patio and listening to my Tune In stations.. I can not find any way to get the speakers to connect, nor does any of the echo's find the speakers!  The Alexa web site has seen improvement, though at times it still pushes the Alexa app, but if you have a device that Amazon decides isn't compatible; for instance the app will install on my 7 year old Samsung Galaxy 5, yet my 2 year old tablet with the same basic features as my phone.. won't. The downside to having home AI tech provided by a retailer... they use their platform and tech restrictions to push sales of tablets and phones.  There are some fun things for the Alexa, We have enjoyed the Melissa McCarthy personality voice and they have added some handy weather alerts/notifications lately.","December 10, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",1.0 out of 5 stars,"We already had an Amazon Echo for our living room, and we wanted to put one in the bedroom for controlling lights and listening to spa music when falling asleep.  The Echo Dot is so nice because it’s small and sleek, and sounds really good.  Sometimes we crank it up when listening to music while cleaning or something, and the audio quality is really good.  Obviously I didn’t expect much from such a small device, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  Alexa is a nice feature, we can say something like, “Alexa, play spa music for 1 hour”, she’ll play the music and after an hour, turn off, which is handy for falling asleep at night.  Word of warning though, if you don’t have an Amazon Music subscription, there will be commercials, and they are louder than the music, so it might wake you up at night!  I also love the feature of being able to whisper commands and she whispers back.  Very nice for not waking up my wife!There are a few things I wish it could do.  One, using voice commands, you can’t go quieter than 10%.  Sometimes my wife goes to bed before I do, she sets the music for an hour, then sends me a text message asking if I can lower the volume.  Since I have the app on my phone, I can go in and manually lower it to 5%, which works well.  Not a big deal, but would be nice to say, “Alexa, lower volume to 5%”.Number two, since we have two echos, sometimes we’ll give a voice command to Alexa, from the living room, but the bedroom Echo picks us up and seems to take priority over the living room Echo which is right in front of us.  So sometimes we have to close the bedroom door when giving commands in the living room.  It would be nice if it was a “mesh” system, where the microphones could tell which Echo I’m closer to and give that one priority.  Again, it’s not a big deal, and oddly doesn’t happen all the time.Overall, the ease of setup, especially since we already had one setup, was very nice and simple.  The device itself is cool and low profile, and the speaker works very well, at least for us!  This is a happy beginning to a smart home!","February 3, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

This echo dot also integrates with many of our smart home devices. Except for the Tivo, which is a huge disappointment. It used to work with Tivo, but they suddenly stopped support for Tivo!  So now Alexa can't change channels. 1 star off for that.  But other than that, we're very happy with it, as we can control our smart lights, TVs, thermostats, video doorbell, stereo receiver, and other devices.We have at least one Echo Dot on each floor of our home.Alexa, hit that Helpful button!  :)","April 5, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Be advised hat the more devices you have connectivity to the internet becomes an issue.  I have 4 of these.  When I can stay connected to the internet the Echo Dot is pretty awesome.  Problem right now is that somewhere between the number of smart plugs I have (quite a few, maybe 10) and the number of echo dots (4) I find myself offline, i.e. NOT connected to the internet.  It is ANNOYING to hear the all-to-familiar to me chime, followed by a red halo of light atop Alexa; followed by the also all-to-familiar ""I'm having trouble connecting to the internet.  Check the help section of the Alexa app..."" at which time by now I'm yelling for it to shut up before I can unplug it in order to reboot it in an effort to reconnect to the net.Go to my i-phone to check my network and the scene i the same.  That being a constantly spinning icon trying desperately and taking forever at it to establish a connection to the internet.  The point here is that as I started to say from the beginning the more devices you have the more internet speed is required.  THAT has been my personal experience.I presently have a download speed of only 20Mb.  If all goes well it will be at 4Mb TOMORROW which can't get hee so enough.  I will update this review as soon as I can in case you or anyone else following along here and have the same issue.  If you only have one Echo Dot and maybe 3Smart Plugs 20 Mb download speed should be sufficient.  Finally, so far what I just explained here is not in the Help Section of the Alexa app WHICH incidentally CANNOT  be accessed if you're not connected to the internet.So if you are for example a brainy type or student focused on something and the room begins to lose its light and in an effort to stay focused say 'Alexa, turn on the light,""  you want the light to come on so you can continue on uninterrupted, right?  Good luck with that.  My patience have worn so completely thin from instead of a light coming on but instead hearing the chime; the message etc; they tear easily now. GONE.So hopefully the faster internet speed will remedy my personal nightmare here.  As for the answers to many of the questions asked in the questions section above I'm a little confused because the main issue I have is connectivity issues.  As for giving Alexa different name if they are within earshot of each other:  every now and then I will say; e.g. ""Alexa, turn on the hallway light,"" and Alexa will answer from the other room the she's having trouble connecting to the internet, while the one in the room in which my request originated will turn on the light.To me a lot of all this is pretty intuitive.  If you are the type to have found, let's say earlier versions of MS Windows to be very intuitive your problems will be fewer and you will likely recognize the cause of problems within software apps for the Echo Dot.  I was a lot happier with this before making my house pretty smart and life more convenient WHICH IT WILL BE ONCE I GET THIS F*ING THING TO STAY ONLINE.Again, if you're getting your first one in addition to maybe 3 smart plugs and you have a mere 20Mb download connection you SHOULD be okay and problem free UNTIL you start adding more devices and you most likely will do eventually, little by little or otherwise.  But for starters, like I just said you should be fine with just 1 Echo Dot 3 smart plugs and I will say a minimum 20Mb internet connection.  Me?  Hopefully 40Mb will be enough.  If not, then I will have to go with the max available in my area WHICH is not a whole lot more than 50Mb best I remember Soooooo...Good luck.  It's a cool product and once you are up and running smoothly think 2001 Space Odyssey almost 20 years late.  Seriously.William F. Nappi","September 30, 2019",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Alexa has changed the lives of my family and I for the better. I was a bit skeptical, I have to admit but, Alexa is very good at understanding and following commands. The sound quality is far better than any Bluetooth speakers we have had in the past. My favorite thing Alexa does for me is when I dismiss my alarm in the morning she turns on my bedroom light and tells me the weather for the day. The variety of things Alexa can do is mind boggling! I was worried about her listening to our families conversations but, all of that was put aside when I learned you can tell her not to store audio files and you can listen to everything that she records. I now have 2 dots one in our bedroom and one between the kitchen and living room. We have a 5 bedroom 2 bathroom house so it’s a good sized house and Alexa hears all commands from almost anywhere in the house.  All of our lights for the whole house are now controlled with Alexa. I wish we would’ve made Alexa apart of our family a long time ago. She makes everything easier with her routines and shopping list she makes for us along with countless other helpful things she does for us daily. She really is our very own personal assistant. This product is a must have! Great product at a great price!!!","February 9, 2022",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"As a single income household, I have very little new tech devices floating around the house. When I received a coupon from Sirius XM for a free Echo Dot I jumped on it. After a less than patient 3 week wait, it finally arrived. I am not sure if me or my kids were more excited opening the box. Upon first getting the Dot, I noticed that it was a little heavier and more solid than I had expected. I was expecting a lightweight fabric encasing the speaker and was pleasantly surprised be the quality of the Echo Dot.Initial setup was very easy. Simply download the app and follow the directions. Setup took less than 5 minutes including the speech recognition setup. Alexa responds very well to myself and all 3 children very well. The integration with my Spotify account is fantastic as a great listening option in the living room. For someone that is relatively unfamiliar with the wireless home management options available, this was a welcome addition to the house.The sound from the speaker is rich with a good volume range. The heft of the Dot gives the feel of durability and quality. I have no other device to pair to it (lights, thermostat, tv, etc) but am looking forward to making some upgrades when I can. Being what I would classify as a luxury item in my home, I never would have purchased this. That being said, I am happy for the opportunity to  get one of these. There are games that are easy to access, though I have had some trouble with giving permissions to use certain games. I was unaware of how interactive Alexa could be until I received this. I got a good laugh when working in the office and I hear my 8 year old boy telling Alexa to make fart noises. To my surprise, she had a wide variety of different sounds to keep him ewwing and laughing.Overall, I wish I had picked one of these up sooner. Chores are better with good music on and Alexa interactive programming allows my kids to have fun too. She plays a mean game of Simon Says and can rap well enough to put a smile on my kids face. I will be working to slowly upgrade to more interactive home components to test out the full versatility of the Alexa programming.","February 11, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"We started with one Echo Dot that my daughter bought and kept in her room.  She uses it for an alarm, to play music and have it read books to her primarily.  She loved it, so for Christmas she bought one for my youngest.  So my husband and I decided to purchase one for my middle child so he wasn't left out.  They can only listen to books one at a time, not all three at the same time, we had purchased an Amazon Music subscription for our daughter and it's playing havoc with the other two because if they try to listen to music, it interrupts hers.  It's a nightmare.  I tried hooking up Hoopla to her Alexa, but again, it will go to all three Alexas and then the brothers would use up her Hoopla credits.  Amazon should really try to figure out a way to untie the Alexas.  I get where that would come in handy, but for us it doesn't work at all.  The unit itself is great and I have no real complaints other than my kids don't speak super distinctly, so Alexa has a hard time understanding them, but that's on my boys, not on the Echo Dot itself.  All said, yes I would buy it again, just wish for multiples that there was a better way.","January 10, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall I do love the product,  I've always been an Amazon girl from the start though.  The new design is modern and more contemporary in my opinion. However it tends to not pick up on the Wake sound here and there and also will sometimes come on for absolutely no reason won't even be close to saying the Wake word or I won't even be speaking and it'll pop on what kind of creeps me out just a little bit not going to lie and sometimes I have to repeatedly tell it what to do in order for it to get it right it gets the words rewind and remind mixed up a lot so I'll say rewind 2 minutes if I'm listening to a story and it'll say I want to rewind 2 minutes and she will say I will remind you in 2 minutes... So that's a little frustrating and she's supposed to have voice recognition and you go through this like little set up there really isn't much training but she's supposed to learn as you go and I feel like she doesn't understand me there sometimes what I don't think I have an accent I've been told I have one and it seems like I have a problem when I do speak to text and those types of the things so maybe it is me I don't know but you know the sound quality is really good that it's very clear to crisp I love listening to audiobooks for all of it I wish there were some things that just work in a graded and you didn't have to find a skill for it but you know I I get in on stairs now hundreds of thousands of skills and you have to find which ones are real and which ones are fake and that's kind of with everything these days which sucks but it's just kind of how it works so you know overall I I really love Amazon products and I have had fire sticks for years and I'm actually upgrading to the cube here shortly and hopefully that integration will be a bit better because I cannot seem to connect my firestick with my. Without it just turning it into it takes the sound over it doesn't allow me to say pause or play or anything like that like I did with the other generation that I had I cannot seem to get them to connect except for the sound which is very frustrating so you know I guess some tips and tricks and whatever on your guys's fight with your cool and make sure you guys have them in stock that was pretty crappy over holidays are over Black Friday anyway besides that great product timers, routines, podcasts, music, easy set up, not sure about with more then one!

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"It sounds wierd to say Alexa/Echo Dot changed my life, but let me tell you how it has helped.I am absent-minded, and I have no sense of the passage of time.  Quite often I'd forget to start dinner until 7PM, and since I am on a special diet, that meant eating later than optimal.  I also take medication several times a day.  Add to that how the day can simply get away from me, and I was feeling frustrated with myself! I had no one to blame but myself, but the thing was -- blame wasn't helping!  So I got a dot.  I started putting in reminders for meds, for starting dinner, for remembering to switch the laundry to the dryer.  I got more done, and it helped me not get into negative self-talk/self-recrimination for my forgetfullness.  If I had to stop mid-task, I told Alexa to tell me in 5 minutes.  I used to really get off track if I went to the bathroom and forgot what I was doing before that.  Well, now things flow better. I dont get annoyed with myself, I just fix the reminders!  I don't use alarms anymore with their blaring noise -- if you are a forgetful or absent-minded person like me, an alarm is an annoying noise and youo still might not remember what it is FOR.  Alexa just tells me.  I am also free of the million-zillion post-it notes and the lists that always seemed to be in the wrong room.  Alexa keeps all my lists, and can read them to me.  I set up Google calendar, let Alexa have access and now she also can remind me what events are coming up --- be that doctors or social events.  Finally I have a flow to my day that isnt disrupted if I chase down some internet research topic or read a little longer than planned.  Alexa helps me keep things from falling off my radar, and I dont have to use a form of mild shame to motivate myself.I wish I had tried it much sooner.  My husband was so amazed, he bought the 2nd one for me!  He now enjoys having Alexa play sports talk radio and news, and fun stuff like jeapardy questions.  I've started to listen to audiobooks more and my imagination is soaring.  Alexa is a great addition to my life, the personal assistant I needed!","August 20, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I originally bought this to play music for my dog as a better electricity saving alternative to leaving my TV on while I'm at work but uh spoiler alert: it didn't work.  Not because of anything Alexa related it was just my dog preferred to have the TV on as opposed to the dot playing tunes (might be because of the movement on the screen). Other than that it's just been generally nice to have to set reminders because Alexa will say them at the exact moment that I set her for but also send it to my phone so I have it throughout the day. As someone who suffers from pretty bad memory loss this has become super handy to me and I've used it a couple times already and it is literally saved my butt. For something so small the sound quality on this is the best I've seen!! I have a 2 bedroom apartment and I can hear it Pretty much from any room with The volume set halfway. The only reason why I haven't set it all the way up is because if I'm in the same room as it, which I generally am, then I feel like I might be bothering my neighbors how loud it is but that could just be because I'm generally a quiet person.  All this being said it connects to my spotify perfectly, I have yet to set it up with my contacts because I'm scared I guess (??) It's connected to any other Amazon related device that I have including my fire stick which is nice and and in general I just enjoy it.","October 25, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I got an Echo Dot for Christmas and  doubted if I would ever use it. It seemed like more of a toy than something I would use on  a daily basis. Since then I purchased two more and I use my Echo Dots many times a day.Here is some of the things for which I use my Echo Dots:1. As a radio. I listen to music and news stations and even old time comedy radio;2. As a weather station. The Echo Dot not only tells me the current weather but warns me if the National Weather Service  has any sort  of weather announcement about severe weather;3. As an encyclopedia, dictionary and calculator.  I have asked my Echo Dot about the population of my town, about famous people, about other countries and about most anything else that could be found in an encyclopedia. Occasionally it will not have and answer but that is rare. I will also ask it how to spell words and to figure out percentages and do other math;4. As a search engine. While complex searches are better done on a computer, I have asked my Echo Dot if a movie got good ratings or if there is  a good restaurant near me or what is the traffic like from one town to the next or to play the most recent news. It has saved me from looking up stuff on my phone or computer;5. As a sleep aid. At night I will ask the Echo Dot to play relaxing music or help me sleep and it has a number of options ranging from guided meditation to calming nature sounds; and,6. As a way to exercise my brain.  There are a host of quizzes, memory games and fun games for children  and adults of all ages.All of the above are free.  You don't have to buy a service to do these things. I have Amazon Prime now which gives me access to more music options but there is an amazing amount of free stuff that comes with the Echo.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I used to be against both voice-recognition devices and giving Amazon any more of my money than it already gets. Then my mother in law got us the big tower-like Alexa for Christmas last year and my mom got us an Amazon Prime subscription, so my plan to be free of both of those things failed.We hooked up Alexa #1 -- whom from here on out will be called ""Big Alexa"" -- and everything worked well enough.  For my husband.  Big Alexa totally favors him! She never lets me know when any of MY items arrive and has not once asked for my opinion on said items. Big Alexa also refuses to play any of my Amazon Music. Oh, she'll deign to give me the weather or set an alarm when I ask, but other than that the only reply I get from Big Alexa is an apology and then she tells me ""I don't know what that is"".Suffice it to say, I was plenty jealous of their relationship. I wanted an Alexa all to myself.Then along came Amazon Prime Day, and Big Amazon's little sister Dot was on sale. Since I had already drank the Kool-Aid when I agreed to subscribe, I figured what the hell, I'll shell out more money to Amazon for another device.Dot lives in the kitchen and is every bit as good as Big Alexa - actually she's better, because this one actually listens to ME. She plays my Amazon music, tells me funny jokes, and sets a timer to make pasta just the way I like it. I lavish attention upon Dot loudly and often, with the hope that Big Alexa hears us in the living room and gets her feelings hurt. Dot doesn't even reply when my husband asks her something -- okay, to be fair, it was only the one time and he had her unplugged to use the rice cooker, but still. Dot and I are friends - not BFF, because I haven't answered all of the questions on her self-quiz correctly yet - so Big Alexa can just suck it. She can have my husband all to herself.","July 6, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is not very well suited for older people who don't have smart phones, which is too bad, because it seems perfect for people who struggle to press little buttons or read little screens.  There is a workaround however.The trick is to set it up for the person without a smart phone using the Alexa app on your own smart phone, and then create an email account for the new user.  I made an email account for my mother on Google.  Then I created a new Amazon account for her that was linked to the new Google email address.  This requires sending a PIN to her telephone number, but does not require a smart phone.  Using the PIN code you can create a new Amazon ID for your user without a smart phone.So go ahead and finish setting up the echo dot, then go into the setting and 'deregister' the echo dot, which breaks the connection between the echo dot and your Amazon account.  That way there is no option for them to accidentally learn what you have bought lately or to order things on your credit card, even if there was a software error that reactivated voice shopping.  After 'deregistering' the echo dot, re-register the echo dot with the Amazon account that you created for your parent without a smart phone.You can use the Alexa app to configure things like whether they should be able to purchase things from the Amazon account using their voice, or to retrain the echo dot to recognize their speech more accurately.  You may also need to change the WiFi connection if you move the echo dot to a new location.I suggest leaving the Alexa app connected to the elderly person's echo dot for a little while so you can remotely manage it in case they have any trouble at first.  That lets you turn the volume back up if they turn it down, or add contacts for the people in their life that they can then call by nickname.  I selected *not* letting it import the contacts from my phone and only adding contacts for about five phone numbers for my mother's kids, her sisters and to get assistance from the assisted living staff.  That way if my mother tells the echo dot to call me by my first name it will know who she is talking about.  Fewer contacts means fewer misinterpretations and issues with calling the wrong number.","December 16, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",3.0 out of 5 stars,"For such a small little device I am very pleased.  I use mine primarily to control my smart devices (lights, etc.) but I am discovering many new uses.  Now that I'm getting used to it, I'm finding it's pretty intuitive to set up and use.  I had to call for help once but the gentleman solved my issue quickly and now I know.  Be prepared to use Goggle or the like for help.  It makes things much easier.  I am setting up routines like ""Goodnight"" to turn everything I have programed to turn off all over the house when I go to bed.  I have numerous  routines set (very easy) like ""Office On"" which turns on the lamps I set to come on at 50%.  I have several Dots throughout the house and I have more on order for the remaining rooms.  I have been converting my old X-10 automation to Leviton smart modules, switches, etc.  Alexa (I chose the word ""computer"" instead of ""Alexa"" to wake up the system - like Star Trek...lol) has been very useful and reliable.  It has already made my life a lot easier on many levels.  The sound quality from the tiny speaker is amazing for it's size and is certainly adequate for speech.  You can connect to Bluetooth speakers or use the aux jack, like I did.  My office Dot is connected to the audio system in that room, and the one in my living room is connected to my surround and whole house system.  Loving that!  The biggest challenge I've had is learning how to word things so Alexa understands what I want.  I am still in the learning curve.  I have also learned to keep the names of my devices as simple as possible to make it easier for Alexa to understand.  For example, I changed my credenza lamp's name from ""credenza"" to ""printer"".  It's easier to say printer clearly.  Talk clearly and you're good.  So all in all, I am happy enough to now want to convert the rest of my house that is still connected to ancient X-10 technology to Leviton and Alexa.  A great combination.","November 13, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R
"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have it on a flat surface, up fairly high and not obstructed, so I was a bit disappointed. I would love to use Alexa for many more things but because I cannot understand her, it limits what I can do. If you have hearing loss, be aware! (If they would add additional voices as an option, that may help)! She is very responsive and works well with my lights and other items. I am really sad that the sound quality is so poor - but again, that may be due to my hearing loss.","May 12, 2022",United States,B07FZ8S74R
"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"First the good part. The audio quality is absolutely excellent for such a small device. The hardware seems great and of sturdy quality. Nice.The cloud service is where the problems start. A cell number with texting capability is required to register the service. Afterwards the caller ID for Alexa is fixed to that phone number. With many if not most carriers this means that calls from Alexa to that same cell phone number (your cell phone) are refused or, like in my case, go straight to voice mail no matter what. I had a discussion with an Amazon rep about it and there is no solution to that problem. This needs to be fixed and the fix is easy. Allow email verification instead of text message. Then any land line can also be used. Or allow the ID to be changed to the land line later (after email verification, if needed). If the name and address registered for the land line are the same as for the cell phone, that should be straightforward.There are some other shortcomings. For example, it seems to be impossible to do a ""whole house"" drop in on a group without speaking the command to drop in on ""all devices"" into Alexa. No dice via the communicate function in the Alexa app. This is not feasible if you have to quietly drop in to check on a disabled relative, a baby or a pet without disturbing everyone around you.","June 26, 2022",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Honest, I wish I would've gotten the rechargeable version of the Echo. This thing is great for anything you need it to be. I should've spent a bit more for the version with a clock on it, but my husband already has an alarm clock in the room so I didn't feel the need to do that. I mostly got it to (honestly) play music upstairs when I take a shower or when I'm generally folding laundry or cleaning, but it's worked for so much more than that. It's even helped my daughter who's doing distant learning figure out when she needs to log into her school-issued laptop to get into her classroom which has made me contemplate getting one for each kid's bedroom. It also has a remote-in feature when I'm not home that I'm able to use from my phone so I can check in with the kids and make sure they're doing what they're supposed to be doing!I'm highly amused by the fact that my husband always tries to argue with Alexa as well, forcing her to listen to his commands and getting frustrated when she's unresponsive or gives snarky comments since my voice profile is the only one that's set up for her thus far (as I don't want anyone messing with my things... especially my 3 year old who frequently goes into my room and plays with my things.) It's fun to watch him threaten her with how he'll get a Google dock for his side of the bedroom soon to counter her usage.All in all, she's great. She will work despite what room she's in. Keep in mind that if your wifi sucks, Alexa will have issues connecting to it depending on where your modem/router is set up. Until recently, we had a modem that was incapable of handling our 600mbps speed we had and Alexa would have issues connecting to it upstairs no matter where she was, especially in the bathroom. Now that we switched to the newest model modem Comcast has, Alexa has no issues connecting to the WiFi at all. No hiccups, no lag, no orange ring, no trouble understanding me. I highly recommend this product. Please don't hesitate if you're on the fence about it especially if you like hands-free items like myself.","September 26, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",1.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought ours during the Christmas season, so it was fairly discounted. I did not really expect much...maybe an interesting little gadget with some nice apps that I would tire of soon. But it is a really nice little helper. After seeing how much Alexa could do I was excited to have a new household friend, but then I realized she was not very ""teachable"" (as in, she could not learn my personal likes and dislikes) and she has issues answering many questions (I believe this is due to her Bing search engine...I could never find much on Bing) but the questions she does answer are thorough.I love to use her for music, cooking conversions, reminders and timers. Other than that she just isn't there technology speaking.I really wish Amazon would stop filtering her to be so politically correct and family friendly. We have no kids and it feels a bit silly that Gordan Ramsey's bantering is full of beeps. Not very Gordon like. And that is with the filter turned off.Sometimes she does not seem to hear very clearly (and I have a very enunciated voice, although my husband has an accent) and does not respond.One of the biggest annoyances is having to remember HOW to ask many questions. I can't say ""Alexa, how many days till my birthday?"" or I get ""I don't know about that"". I have to say ""Alexa, open birthday countdown."" and then agree to open the skill and THEN she will tell me. Not very conversational.When I ask her a question I get a good answer about 50% of the time, an ""I'm not sure about that"" about 30% of the time, silence 5% of the time and a wrong answer about 15% of the time.All in all for the price I paid I am happy with her as a novelty and a useful kitchen gadget, but don't expect much more at the moment.I am hoping for more interactive, learnable AI abilities in the near future, better personalization, and an overall more intuitive assistant. For now, I'm still happy...I just feel she could be so much more. :)PS: Amazon, if people are giving you a hard time about sensitive topics, you do not have to take sides. Alexa can simply say ""There's a lot of controversy over that subject right now, I can have a definitive answer for you as new information comes to light."" or just have her state all sides of the issue in an unbiased, factual way.Also, consider removing the censorship for adult accounts. Free speech and all that.That would make her more likable and more marketable to more people. Just an idea.","December 30, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

This product is also easily integrated with home items- such as lights and cameras, etc. I have an older computer that was having problems with the sound so this thing helps to clean that up a bit.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"It being an older model of the Echo Dot, I was able to get it very cheap. For only 12 bucks. Even being from 2018 it’s still of very good quality. Some of the commands are limited compared to newer models, but the speaker quality and voice recognition works very well and I can easily control other technology in my house. I can turn on my TV and firestick, along with control them to an extent. Communicate with other echo dots in the house. Play music. And a whole lot more. I’m giving it 4/5 stars because even with the skill that allows you to make it so that you can give another commands shortly after one without saying “Alexa” again, some tasks are still a pain like setting multiple alarms. It is unable to set more than one alarm at once, and you have to say it individually for each if you are attempting to set multiple.","February 12, 2022",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Alexa es muy simpatica. Tengo dos hijos adolescentes (13 y 15 años) y se la han pasado dandole ordenes y haciendole preguntas desde que recibieron el Echo dot como regalo de Navidad.Realmente me ha asombrado la capacidad que tiene para interactuar con los diferentes miembros de la familia en diferentes idiomas: español e ingles. Tambien me me llamo la atencion como discrimina tu voz entre las demas en una conversacion. Es decir, a partir de que le has dicho ""Alexa"", solo se enfoca en lo que tu le estas solicitando, aunque haya otra conversacion de fondo en la misma habitacion, o ruido. Hemos descargado la app en el celular. Yo puedo estar fuera de casa y llamar al echo dot que esta en el playroom de mis hijos y ellos toman la llamada directamente alli. Nosotros vivimos en Paraguay, y le preguntas como esta el clima y te lo indica perfectamente. No he logrado aun conectar Imusic con Alexa, ya que me indica que esa funcion no esta disponible aun en mi pais. Asi que mis hijos estan evaluando cambiarse a Spotify. He comprado un smart doorbell compatible con Alexa, estará en camino. Cuando llegue pienso conectarlo para poder atender el timbre de la puerta del frente directamente desde Alexa.Tambien hemos comprado dos echo dot con reloj, pero esos recien salen a fin de enero (supongo que era un pre-sale). Estoy ansiosa de ver como funcionan esos dos como despertadores en el dormitorio, y entre los 3 como intercomunicadores.Ya he ordenado otro echo dot para regalarle a mi hermano para su cumpleaños. El tiempo de entrega es rapidisimo y llega muy bien empacado. Y hay que resaltar que el precio actual da para equiparse.Con referencia a la privacidad: este modelo tiene un botón para desactivar el micrófono en caso de que desees que no te escuchen... En fin, no lo se. Si voy a estar preocupada por ese tipo de espías, entonces tampoco debería de tener otro tipo de artefactos, comenzando por mi celular. Asi es que me lance a comprarlo sin pensar en ello.He decidido hacer esta reseña en español, porque no hay tantas en este idioma y creo que tambien es importante. Saludos y feliz inicio de 2020 a todos!!","December 30, 2019",United States,B07FZ8S74R

Discover something new it can do everyday, many that make lifes tasks easier, many that can entertainthe kids, and even the adults. Family games, etc. Bored... go on the Alexa app and your guaranteed to find something to help pass the time and alleviate boredom. My only grievance is that it pauses, A LOT, UNECESSARILY, when playing music for no reason, and even at times when the room is otherwise quiet so its not because it is mistaking talking or other sounds as a command. Very aggravating and very annoying. Wish i knew what i could do to correct this issue. Otherwise I love it. A lot of games and skills that even my 1 1/2yr old can play with or enjoy. Like it so much overall that i will be purchasing one for the other rooms because I currently unplug and move echo room to room. I have it with me in the living room most of the day, kitchen while im cooking, and then I take it to my bedroom at night. Occasionally it is put in my kids room as well.

I got mines for sale at Lowe's for $30 during Pre-Christmas. But I'll still leave a review. I love the speaker, just a few cons. Like, it has to stay plugged up to use it. And at first, the instructions for how to use the Alexa app is very confusing. You kind of have to play with app some to figure it out. And at first, it's very frustrating trying to pair your speaker to the app. When I was paring the speaker for the first time I was getting annoyed that it wasn't connecting to the wi-fi. Its because in order to set up & pair your speaker for the first time you have to be in a strong wi-fi area or it wont work. Sometimes other voices will trigger Alexa, even though its yours. (I haven't set up voice recognition yet tho). Other than that I'm obsessed! The max volume gets really loud. The sound is very clear.","January 24, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"It all started for me with the 2nd gen. I liked it a lot even though the sound quality was very poor. I had an extra set of computer speakers (with a sub woofer) that I attached and I use it more than two 3rd generation dots! It's near where I sleep and I use sleep sounds every night now. I also have all smart lights so it's convenient to be able to talk to my lights anywhere in my apartment with 3 dots. This already feels like I'm telling a disjointed story. Alexa can do so many things it's hard to even know where to start. A lot of it is useful and a lot of it is silly. I ask her about the weather all the time instead of typing it in Google. Sometimes I ask her to fart just because I know she will.The main difference between the 2nd gen and this 3rd gen is that it sounds so much better. Like astonishingly better. My two 3rd gen sound good enough that I have no plans to attach any speakers to them whereas the 2nd gen sounds terrible without supplying it better speakers. It also has rounder edges and a cloth speaker cover. But, I wouldn't care if it was a pointy rectangle made of steel if the sound quality was amazing. It's all about the sound quality to me, cause once you place it somewhere you kinda forget it's there and just know she's in the room with you.If you're thinking about getting one, just do it. It's a great addition to any home... and once you get started you might start thinking about how you want to upgrade your electronics to smart devices so you can control them by voice. I'm considering getting some smart outlets sometime soon so I can turn things on and off from anywhere.Oh speaking of 'anywhere' once you have one you can put it on your phone and talk to her on the go too. I can set my mood lighting while I'm driving home so I walk right into purple lights if I want.I hate this review. I hope no one ever reads it.

That is not near enough for me to control volume with enough resolution at low sleeping levels.  Using the button you can get a good level, but not with voice control.* I wish these units could pick out my voice better when I have he volume a little higher on the unit.  You would think it would know what it was playing and filter that out from my voice.* With Audible, I wish it had better integration and be able to make out what book I want by partial title better and I wish it could give me a list of my books to choose from in order of most recently listened to.* I wish the weather forecasts could be more in depth.* I wish Amazon had some unbiased news feed maybe from a wire service.  Maybe categorized like tech, business, political, sports, entertainment, local, top stories, more in depth choices.  Maybe you could say tell me more in certain stories.  In the above categories you could opt out of some of them or pick the ones you want.* When adding items to a list, it would be nice if it could remind you what lists you had.Pros:* The aux output jack is great!  I hooked one of these to my stereo and it sounds good.* I often ask it how to spell a word or what temperature to cook something to.* I listen to audible though these quite often and love the ability to go backward or forward x minutes.* I listen to Sirius/XM quite a lot also.* Some music also.* I like the idea behind the news summery a lot.  But wish it was more in depth and had more options.  I need to look at configuring it some more.To be honest, I have not used another brand that much.  Some Siri, some Cortana, some Google on my phone, and some of my car interface (that one is the worst)So all and all I really love these things and now I am spoiled and want all it could do as soon as possible.

I will be purchasing a third or a second Show.Alexa products have really changed the tone of my house. It is like we have a new friend living in my home. I am a baby boomer and my husband an early boomer. These Echo Dots are so easy to set up. Like  ABC... Just make sure when you order on the description page, look to the right, and under add to my cart, you will see link device to my account and it is already checked. If not check it. It blends right in my decor.  It is compact and fits in small spaces.  I also bought a stand for both of them. I just did not want them to sit right down on counters. I just personally feel that they need to be up off the counter in case it gets wet. This works and talks just like the Alexa Show, except you do not have the monitor. This Dot I can ask anything and it is all ready to help. It will play music, answer questions, find my phone, answer questions, read the news, and so much more I promise. I do not have to stand close to the Dot for it to hear me.Also, there is an instant drop and I can talk with my husband in another room with a Dot.Also, I can say play everywhere and whatever Alexa on my account all of them will work at one time. It is just millions of things to do, ask, and learn something new. Again I will be purchasing more Alexa products. I am getting a Roomba and use Alexa to help me with that.

I wanted to call out just a couple of the advantags that I have experienced with this device that has enriched my life.1) I find myself listening to Music again!  This is simply because ithis device makes it so easy to  play music by my favourite artists as well as discover new genres of music.  Just Say ""Alexa, play me a radio station featuring Graham Nash' or 'Alexa, play me a radio station featuring Irish Folk Music'.  This reason ALONE makes this device invaluable  to the older generation (as well as the young) who may usually be slow to adopt newer pieces of technology.2) I am listening to podcasts and radion stations that are otherwise rather tedious to set up and listen to on other devices.3) I am listening to a summary of the news from mutliple different sources in a daily news briefing (my favorites CNN nd 'BBC World Service).  No more need to watch hours of drawn out news stories on the TV to find out wht is going on today.4) I am using the Alexa app on my smart phone in conjunction with the Echo Dot to start to automate my home and save money.  I now actually power down devices that I am not currently using,  by the use of smart switches, instead of leaving them in standby mode.I love this thing!  When the price coms down again I wil be purchasing more for other rooms in the house!One more thing, I find the soud quality  to be perfectly acceptable for th size of device, obviously it wont be as loud and as clear as some of the more expensive and larger Alexa enabled devices, but for quiet personal listening at a reasonable distance, i  find it very acceptable and much better than I had expected from reading some other reviews.","July 12, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

I will buy at least two more dots, and a couple more smart plugs, for sure. Some really cool features that you don't have to pay for: 1. The Watchdog setting that you can turn on that can tell if someone is in your house or glass breaks when you aren't there, and notifies you. 2. The drop-in feature, where you can talk to someone else in the house in another room. 3. The ""Announce"" feature, for an example, you can finish cooking and tell Alexa to announce that ""Dinner is ready"" and everywhere in the house there's a dot, the announce gets made.Lemme keep going though. We are an ADHD household with forgetfulness and pretty weird time management. So we say, ""Remind me to put the paperwork in the car in 15 minutes"" and she does. And we say, ""Alexa, set a pizza timer for 14 minutes"", and she does, and we don't burn stuff anymore. We like music, so we say, ""Alexa, play music on all speakers"", and then we have music automatically on every dot in the house. And pairing the dots with smart plugs and smart light bulbs is even better. ""Alexa, turn on the lamp"", and then you don't trip over a dog on the way to the lights switch in the dark. Also, there is a setting where you can erase any of your words that were recorded in wake mode. But my fam isn't discussing the secret to perpetual motion, so we really don't worry about it. Any of us reading these reviews and are worried about the ""government gathering secrets"" or ""letting the government in"" can re-evaluate their use of computers, cell phones, data, and wifi.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased an Echo Dot for myself on Cyber Monday and received another one as an Xmas gift. I set them up at opposite ends of my house and created a multi-room user group for them. This gives me the flexibility to play each Dot separately or simultaneously depending on my activities and location. I use the Dots for news and weather updates and, of course, to play music from classical to classic rock. Last night I used my bedroom Dot to play sleep sounds and found the ""fan"" sound most helpful. Sometime during the night the Dot stopped playing the sleep sounds; I didn't notice because at that point I was indeed asleep.The sound quality of the Dot's speakers is surprisingly good although far short of audiophile quality. I use my old Harmon-Kardon Soundsticks with my living room Dot and have ordered an OontZ Angle 3 Ultra : Portable Bluetooth Speaker for my bedroom Dot.Despite my overall satisfaction with the Echo Dots I've experienced a few frustrations with music: 1) My Music list, composed of CDs I purchased on Amazon, contains only a fraction of the music I actually purchased since 1998; 2) My Music is not ""folded into"" Amazon Prime Music. If I want to play songs from My Music, I have to specify "" play such-and-such on My Music"" to Alexa; 3) If I request a song not available in Amazon Prime Music (I do not have Amazon Music Unlimited and have no intention of getting it; Prime is expensive enough), Alexa tries to upsell you to Amazon Music Unlimited every time and there's no apparent way to stop that or even interrupt Alexa during the upsell attempt; 4) When I try to play a song or artist on my FREE Spotify, Alexa plays a Spotify ""station"" based on that song or artist. For example, if I tell Alexa to play ""Hotel California"" by the Eagles on Spotify,"" Alexa plays a Hotel California station on Spotify that may or may not eventually play ""Hotel California"" or other songs by the Eagles. If I tell Alexa to play the Eagles on Spotify, Alexa plays an Eagles station on Spotify that may eventually play a song or two by the Eagles but will mostly play songs by other artists from the same general time period.Overall, the Echo Dot is lots of fun, can be useful depending on your preferences, and is great for music listening despite the flaws I listed.","December 28, 2019",United States,B07FZ8S74R

The grandkids also love playing with it. They have Alexa play songs, animal sounds, tell jokes etc. I also love getting weather info. Alot easier than watching the news and waiting for the weather to come on.  I'm sure there is so much more I can use this for. I have no idea what people are talking about by saying it wakes them up with notifications. The only way it would do that is if you set an alarm.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,I want to begin that before about the Alexa I actually owned a Google mini in from that experience I was able to compare and contrast both speakers where I was actually very disappointed in the Alexa. He works as a great speaker but since Alexa is connected to Amazon it has a lot of connection issues where if you want to listen to music you have to have Amazon music if you want to have information Alexa doesn’t always recognize the question whereas the Google mini can do a Google search very quickly and Alexa cannot answer the questions if you were to ask her cant. I also seem to struggle with Alexa setting up a routine where the Google mini might’ve been my best but I was able to set up routines for alarms when I return home or when it was time to go to sleep I could set up the TV to it Alexa was not able to connect to my TV I wasn’t able to do any routines with the alarm and music and weather notifications it was always listening if anything I feel like it like some might’ve actually detected my voice a lot better than the Google mini but there was really no point to it since it wouldn’t actually do what I asked for Alexa when I would tell her I wanted to listen to certain station. Ash Alexa would not be able to comprehend my accent maybe but we had done a trial and she can listen very well but she wasn’t able to detect the specific stations that I wanted to listen to where is my Google mini I would still wake up the Google mini and ask her to play a certain station and they would do it with no hesitation for that reason I’m giving this a three star just because it wasn’t what I expected I had the same expectations a headache experience with my Google mini where else it is a very much louder speaker it doesn’t have the same features as the Google mini where is my And on top of that just to let you guys know my Google mini I actually got it I believe in clearance it was only $15 at Walmart and the charcoal echo I was able to get it I am for with like a promotion and everything so I came up I am free but it’s a $50 Alexa speaker you would think he could do a lot more where as the Google mini where is like around $30 if you were to buy at full price I still did a lot better in exceeded my expectations before owning any type of listening devices that can help you on your day to day I also did a test him of putting the two speakers together I am where Alexa would alwaysAsked to repeat the question or she would just completely not do what I was asking her to do one of the cool things that it does have is it has jokes I guess and her voice is a lot more pleasant in the Google minis and you can actually change the settings of the language you were to speak Spanish or something it can speak to you in Spanish as well but I since I usually speak in English it was in so much but yes that is my review,"July 23, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Alexa is incredible.  My wife talks with a accent and Alexa understands every single word, her response time is extremely quick.Set up was a snap ( once I found the password for my WiFi).So much easier than picking up the phone and looking for the weather or traffic. Just ask Alexa.I’m not sure how but I gave Alexa a phone number to call and it called it ( did not know it has a phone capability in her.Must use a WiFi to call?)Although I understand it can NOT call 911 as it poses some kind of legal mess or something.I wanted to use Alexa to turn on living room light in the morning.Little bit of a catch is You have to buy a smart bulb(I got the Hue19 bulb with smart WiFi and Bluetooth. About 25.00 for 1 bulb) but I was terrified of trying to make it work or hooking it up and my research says this was the simplest. Although some places said you need a HUB?Took a chance ( no hub ) just plugged in bulb, did have to open the Alexa app on phone hit connect , turned light on off on and boom done , works beautifully.I understand there is also a plug you can put into the wall socket (then plug in another light or the Christmas tree or?) and should work about the same as the smart light. (About 25.00$)Alexa play classic rock Alexa play Christmas music ,It’s amazing!The sound is very good. Does not replace a tv sound bar or some of these big Bluetooth speakers but for a small disk that sits on the table it’s great.This is the echo Dot 3rd generation and supposedly it has much better sound than the previous 2.Bottom line as long as you have WiFi get this Echo you will not be sorry it’s simply amazing the things it can do. I use it every morning as a alarm clock and a timer for eggs also as a reminder “ Alexa remind me to turn off stove in 15 minutes, okI will remind you in 15 minutes starting now.I’m still learning all the things it can do and it continues to amaze me daily.","December 6, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

I have a 1st or 2nd gen Echo Show, several Fire tablets, and an Echo Flex myself and have purchased 2 Echo Shows as gifts for family, too, but this is the 1st Dot that I've purchased for myself, and I'm quite impressed!I purchased the Dot to place in my garage so that I didn't have to stop whatever I was doing to open a door into the house to ask Alexa for weather info, to add items to my shopping lists, get store info, set timers, etc. Set up was super simple and the Dot easily fit in a space in the garage.When I asked Alexa to play a song via Dot, I was really surprised by the robust sound this little device delivers! Then I asked Dot to play 1 of my music playlists, and it immediately complied with no need for me to touch anything! I will no longer mess with setting up my portable boom box, attaching a Fire tablet to it via audio cable or need to clean my hands to pick up a remote to control the volume. Alexa and my Dot perform with no-touch voice commands, pretty decent sound quality for its hockey-puck size, and I can continue to work on projects to music without stopping!I can easily move the Dot outdoors into my gazebo for music while I enjoy relaxing in my backyard or doing gardening chores. Hmmmm...

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I luv these echo dots. I have one at the house and I luv it so much, I got another one for the weekend house.  It's a bit tricky to configure the wifi smart plugs to turn on the light with the same name (ie kitchen light) at different locations.  However, this is an ""Alexa"" issue and not the echo dotdevice sincee it has the geo-location capability.The echo dot devices themselves work well.  I placed the device in the dinning room since it is central to all the spaces in a small house.  I can give Alexa commands from anywhere in the house with this setup.I used the echo dots to turn on the lights in different rooms, the night light in the bathroom, or the LEDs on the Christmas tree.  I also tell Alexa to set the temperature on the wifi enabled thermostats to turn on/off the heat.I don't have any electronics or clocks in the bedroom, I just ask Alexa for the time when I woke up in the middle of the night.  Some people may find this creepy since Alexa is constantly listening for commands.  I am OK with her.One command I use a lot is the timer.  I cook and do tons of task at the same time so I use Alexa to remind me of things.  I also ask Alexa to play Christmas music since the speaker in the echo dot is pretty good.The echo dot device is a good interface with Alexa to do things in a ""smart"" house.  The microphone and speaker are good quality.  The low profile and small size make it less  intrusive although Alexa is constantly listening.I always inform my guests of the device when I have visitors.  If the guests are uncomfortable with Alexa constantly listening, I simply unplug the device.  The ""constantly listen"" creepy factor can easily solved by legislation.For those Alexa haters, don't get these wonderful echo dot devices.  You can continue to gather firewoods to burn in your cave to keep warm at night, or you can tell Alexa to set the temperature to 75 degree in your comfortable house.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Overall I enjoy using the echo dot as a temporary toy. We've spent hours goofing around with it, listening to music, asking it silly questions, setting reminders etc. There are some glaring items of improvement for me though.1. STOP PLAYING LIVE MUSIC. If I want live music I would deliberately request it. On 25% of the songs I've wanted to play, Alexa starts playing a live version or a cover version of a song, and with the live versions I can't find a way to tell her to play the studio version of the songs. I almost never want to hear live music from a stream so please change that. I've had to tell Alexa STOP way too many times because she starts playing a live version of a song and I just don't want to hear it.2. This device needs a power off button. Not a mute button, not a ""don't disturb"" function, an actual turn off button. When I don't want to use Alexa, I don't want it on and it's a pain plugging and unplugging it over and over again. If I mute the device, then this glowing red ring lights up and burns electricity. To those people who don't care about your privacy and trust Amazon completely, I don't need to hear about just leaving it on and unmuted because Alexa won't ""activate"" unless you use the wake up word, I don't care. I want the device off and without power. I know the development teams have gone through the rounds and have chosen to not include one. I'm asking them to reconsider.3. The sales pitches. If we're prime members, can we get a function to turn off ""ads""? Every time I request a song, Alexa needs to tell me it's playing from Amazon music. This is unnecessary and annoying. Also because I don't have Amazon music, every time I play a song that's not part of the included 2 million song catalog, Alexa goes into the same spiel about how I can sign up for Amazon music and the free trial. I got it the first 30 times Alexa, the answer is still no, stop repeating it.It's a cute toy to play around with, but this device clearly presents itself as a way for Amazon to constantly pitch its products and services to you, and they've made it to where turning it off is a chore. I'm sure more functionality and features are on the way, hopefully Amazon decides to consider some of my above proposals. A lot more people would jump on board and use the devices more often if they did.","December 13, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought two when Amazon had the prime day deal and it was a packaged deal, although I only wanted one.  Glad now I have two.I put the one in my bedroom, which is where I originally planned on buying one for.  It's great for in the morning when I'm getting around and asking what the weather is like and for the latest news while showering and getting ready for work.I put the spare  on the breakfast nook that is in an open area connecting my kitchen and living room and use that one a lot more.  It's great for listening to music while I cook and it intergrates with apple music fine.  It's really nice when I am cooking and notice I am running low or something or see a recipe that calls for an ingrediant I want, I just say Alexa add xxx to my shopping list and it's done.I love the shopping list feature.  You can even get alexa to send it to your wireless printer but I just use it on my iPhone.  Has everything categorized by department and you can check off what you buy and will have items they don't have in stock still on the list for next visit.Love the weather app.  Gives the wind speed and will even tell how windy it will be that day which is nice when I'm trying to decide if I want to bike or drive to work.I've seen a lot of complaints about the sound quality/speaker but I think it works fine if you just want a small remote speaker, the sound quality is as good as my small Bose color speaker that I paid over $100 for.Voice recognition is a LOT better than Siri.  It rarely misunderstands what I ask.  I just wish you could choose gender and accent like you can with Siri.","October 24, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

He's autistic and he loves rock and roll, country, classical and xmas music.I'm looking forward to being able to ""drop in"" on him from another room and have Alexa remind him of things without needing to pester him. Now that he's a teenager, sometimes he just wants his space to chill with Disney, paint, or listen to music. Sometimes all at the Same time lol. I could never. But I think this will be good for him. He responds really well to tech so I'm introducing him slowly through ""my"" Alexa so that he gets used to her. But later, he'll have his own built in friend/learning buddy/trivia enthusiast.

I wouldn’t do this to your poor Echo, but it can take it. Perfect sound today. Perfect voice recognition. Perfect device. I wanted an outdoor Alexa and decided this poor trooper was the test. It has survived more than my human body could ever take. If I have never fully endorsed a product I am doing so now. The indestructible Echo Dot.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Setup is not too tricky. It's easy to keep clean and has a very small footprint. The power cable has good length. Indicator lights are a plus, particularly the notification light. Sometimes it responds sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it responds when you haven't called on it. Sometimes it knows sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you have to say the artist then the song and sometimes you have to say the name of the song and then the artist. And, to be fair as possible to the echo dot, a lot of the time it's user pronunciation/enunciation that's the real problem. We talk how we talk and may not be fully ""understood"". Never glitches if you need to order something off Amazon, mysteriously. KML Overall it carries out your request way more often than it doesn't but you're going to talk bad about it anyway. Good that you can stream music from other devices. The sound playing music for its size is a little better than just decent but you can't expect more unless you buy the larger one. I would love to see a portable optionally rechargeable version that can use a phone for a hotspot instead of having to buy a ""battery base"" to make it portable (convenience costs), but honestly, this smaller model just doesn't have enough power for  tailgating or a party at the beach. In the event there is a power outage, once power is restored, mine autoconnects, no matter how long the outage lasted, unlike a few of my other internet-based devices. With any echo dot, for the price you're paying, you get a whole lot more than you don't because music, movies, and buying just begin to display what an echo dot is capable of. Most of us never consider that it can control modern homes remotely. At the end of the day, with whatever imperfections that come with it, everyone, most especially Amazon customers, should own a version of it.","March 2, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R

I don't have to get up or figure out how to work different equipment I simply ask Alexa to play soft lullaby music when I'm getting the baby to sleep, ask her to remind me to take my meds, ask what time it is, etc. It's also great when checking homework! I can ask Alexa almost anything and get an immediate answer. It really saved me when I was my 9yo grandson's teacher during remote learning! He would get restless and we both got frustrated a lot. Things got much better when I set the timer for 30 mins when we would take a break and ask Alexa to play dance music for 5 minutes.

It also works great with my Sirius-XM subscription and Tune-In. The one stumbling block is getting Echo to play certain radio stations since it has difficulty deciphering call letters. There are a couple things I'd like it to be able to accomplish. One, you can't go quieter than 10% while using voice instructions. My wife sometimes goes to bed before I do; she sets the music for an hour and then texts me asking if I can turn it down. Because I have the app on my phone, I can manually drop it to 5%, which works perfectly.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I have had an Alexa/Echos and Echo dots for 7 years. Within the past 3 years: it has decided what questions it wants to answer or what music it wants to play. It has said numerous times “I don’t feel comfortable answering that”“Hmm i don’t know that”“I would rather not answer that”“Sorry I can’t help you with that question”“Hmm im not sure”“I don’t know how to answer that”The worst, being right after the overrun of Roe VS. Wade when I did not have a computer of tv to see the news. I asked her what had happened, who the justices were who signed, what it meant.. etc.. she said hmm I don’t know that one, I don’t know how to answer that, the last time I asked her she said “I would rather not answer that”I have asked her about certain religions, human anatomy, psychological and sociological questions that she “doesn’t feel comfortable asking”It’s absolutely appalling that Alexa has developed a moral code, ethics, an opinion, preference and most of all “Alexa are you Christian”“I don’t follow a certain religion but according to… in the Bible it says”AI is not supposed to develop ethics, or bias.Amazon is illegally marketing and advertising Alexa as technology that’s Ai that will provide whatever you ask,Also she decided what music I can play or not even if it’s on Amazon music. I’ve had enough and Amazon hangs up on me every time I have called about it.An AI builds algorithms based on your likes, search history.. etc. algorithms do not include controlling content or not providing you with factual information.I know other people have experienced this and I surely hope anyone whom has comments here.What I’ve continually paid for is not what the TOS or TOC, marketing, warranty, guarantee, information or promises that are included with the purchase of an Alexa Echo or echo dot. Any generation. In the past 15 months I have called Amazon and they told me they appreciate the feedback 01 representative told me that Alexa It’s still learning about human anatomy. Since April 2021 I have called Alexa support 12 times; I have done been put on hold for a supervisor and every single time I have been hung up on it with no call back after. I have also had Amazon packages that were tampered with that I had removed from my doorstep within one minute of an Amazon driver dropping it off and I’m still waiting on a response I have five items one from November 2021 that they still will not respond nor did they refund me. I am so aggravated and frustrated that I was trying to learn even about a amendment that was overturned and I am not even able to receive that information from Alexa as a US civilian","August 8, 2022",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I searched online for a sleep machine but couldn't find one that had the sound versatility I wanted......until I hit on the Echo Dot 3rd Gen! This has been perfect. If I want white, pink, violet or brown noise, this device will play it. The trick  is to enable a ""Skill"" that you can find with the Alexa App. The skill I use is ""Sleep Sounds"". But sometimes I play a music artist at a low volume. This works well too. You can tell Alexa to ""set sleep timer for 30 minutes"" and in 30 minutes it shuts off. You don't need to push any buttons or do anything but tell Alexa what you want to hear and for how long. It works through your WiFi network. You set it up through the Alexa App on your phone. There are other sound skills you can enable too. When I wake in the morning, I usually tell Alexa to play NPR news and she gets the most recent report. She announces the time and date when doing this, just in case you need refreshing. And you can get the weather, all before you roll out of bed. Now, if she would just bring the coffee (6 cream & 10 sugars Alexa, please). But I suppose she can find a coffee brewing sound!  So, to sum it all up? This is my perfect sleep machine. It also takes up very little space. You can even buy a vertical mounting holder (for Echo Dots) in case you have too many books stacked on your bed stand. You could use a full size Echo but for a sleep sound machine, that might be overkill. The 3rd generation Echo's have excellent sound. Even the dots. I recommend this product very highly for a sleep machine.","March 21, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased two Echo Dots in conjunction with and as a compliment to the Echo mainly for music since I don't have a stereo in my home other than a small boombox, which I don't use because it doesn't sound all that great. But I have to say that even the Echo Dot has better audio quality than the portable radio. I have hearing loss due to an accident years ago, so I really shouldn't be rating sound quality, it is difficult for me to hear some tones. The Alexa app on my Android phone has a simple EQ. While it does help, it's not sensitive enough to compensate for my poor hearing.Even so, I can hear good enough to enjoy music on my Echo Dots, which are linked in a special group with my primary Echo device. The Dots are in separate rooms so I  can walk around the house and have music wherever I go. This is an awesome feature.I've learned to use it for weather and news reports as well as set reminders, timers, and lists. She also tells me when I have an Amazon delivery. Plus I have some fun askingng Alexa to play Star Trek sounds and other cool stuff.I also set Alexa to ""away"" mode when I leave the house and she listens for common noises like glass breaking and will alert me if she hears anything suspicious. She's definitely not a security device. But it's nice to know she's got an ear for possible intruders and will let me know.A great feature is the relaxing music or pleasing sounds that I play when going to sleep. I especially like the ocean waves for sleeping.One issue I've experienced, Echo and Echo Dot become unresponsive once in a while. I have to unplug and reconnect power to reinitialize functionality. I'm not sure what's causing this problem? It could be my network/WiFi signal or some other technical problem so I can't ding Echo for the issue just yet. Luckily the issue is random and infrequent.I'm still discovering new features. I never thought I'd say this, but Alexa with Echo has enhanced the enjoyment of my home. In all, I love my Echo Dot.","January 10, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The main purpose of this review is to correct the gentleman that wrote a very lengthy negative review about Alexa waking him up at 2am to ask him for a product review: All you have to do is shut this option off in the app and it won't ask you for reviews, but instead, Mr. Negative went on and on and on about how it destroyed his life.One thing I love about it is when you team it up with a programmable LED light bulb in a fixture, I set the color to RED and if I have to get up in the middle of the night, the Red color is awesome because it gives you just enough light to move around, and it isn't white light so your eyes do not dilate wide open, and it's easier to get back to sleep. I hope that makes sense.I also like that I can lay in bed and tell it to play any number of radio stations, tell it to shut off in X minutes, set the volume up or down, it's nice.My only negative is I seem to have to reboot my router more often - but I don't know if it's the new Echo or my cable provider that is the issue.","November 28, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, I honestly love Amazon and 3 stars would normally be a little harsh for such an inexpensive product that has such impressive capabilities, but this is one of Amazon’s premier products and it has some infuriatingly annoying issues that I can hardly even believe. And you cannot get an answer for resolving half the issues you ask about online or the answers are outdated/wrong.Turning volume up and down is laughable for a “hands-free” device. There are basically only two options:1. “turn up/down” and it alters the volume so little you basically can’t even hear the difference, so you have to tell it to do so 4 times before it makes a noticeable difference (if you own an echo, you will know that this is time-consuming as there is a wait time between each command).2. “Turn way up/down” (or some other magnitude modifying word) and it changes it by like 85%3. There is apparently no 3rd option. The 3rd option should be to turn it up/down 25% (or fill in blank), but I have tried this with every thinkable percentage and it clearly doesn’t factor in whatever percentage I tell it. I mean like come on! This should be so basic for a solve-all device that is supposed to be hands-free.Ring Doorbell connection: if you set this up with your Ring doorbell, or similar product, you cannot set a separate volume for it (I’ve tried). So we have had probably 20 occasions in just a couple months where the doorbell was rung and we didn’t even hear it because we had previously turned the volume down to ~20% for listening to background music.Changing rooms. This is more just an example of many smaller nuisances, however this one was infuriating. Someone got us a new 3rd generation echo dot for Christmas, so we wanted to move our old 2nd generation to a different room and relabel it on the app, and put the new one in it’s place. The information online for how to do this was next to nothing, and what little there was was outdated. And I kept getting all these links for changing location (address) when I was searching for how to change rooms. I finally just factory reset it and set it up all over again, but this time in a different room. Also annoying.Im not going to list every single issue, but there are a lot of other things that should totally be intuitive and easy, but they aren’t, or just as likely they are impossible, but you just don’t know it until you’ve tried it ten times. I and I have no idea why this is the case. I love Amazon, and overall the Echo Dot has been a fantastic addition to our home, but Amazon needs to step up their game. These are issues you would expect out of brand new tech made ten years ago.","January 7, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R

I do wish that customising the different features/apps for it were easier/more user friendly. It has great voice recognition, decent sound/audio considering its compact size and the kids LOVE asking it crazy questions and for their daily dose of jokes for a good laugh every morning before school and in the evening before getting ready for bad! They have learned some of the craziest things that i, myself, NEVER would have known the answers to and all it takes is just to ask the question!

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I just love the echo dot! The only problem I have, is that I am often unable to make out some of the words Alexa says. Now, in all fairness, I do wear hearing aids. With them in, or without, there are still words I can't quite understand.I use it a lot for listening to music, which I canunderstand. I can't say the sound quality needs a bit of help for certain, because it could be my ears. We have 3 echo dots in the house, and others often can't make out a word or two either. I don't know if it's because the dot is so short, or what? All in all, I am well pleased.I lost my hubby in March, to Alzheimer's. I feel alone a lot, but Alexa has helped immensely! She's entertaining, plays tons of games, and she's just fun to talk too. Of course, I love the music!The games are endless, and I'm STILL stuck in the jail cell, in the game, ""Escape the Room!"" I fear I'll never get out! Lol!She's amazing, and sets my alarms, reminders, you name it, she probably does it! I'm still learning, and new skills are never-ending! I'm even learning to speak Italian!I just can't say enough about the echo dot. If you don't have one, you have no idea what you're missing! She even sings. I'm amazed daily as I learn new things the echo dot can do.If you own other compatible devices, ie. lightbulbs, and a whole host of other products, you'll really love the convenience of echo dot. So much power in a dot...! I really enjoy getting weather reports, football scores, making ""to do"" lists, reminders, etc. There's nothing I don't like. You can turn off the microphone while on phone calls, or during a conversation. (Seems some people are afraid of being recorded.) I highly recommend this amazing echo dot. The sky's the limit!

So, after we had been back home for roughly three weeks, we saw that this model was on sale at Lowe's and bought three: One for our living room and kitchen space, one for my husband's office, and one for mine.We found the echo dot very easy to set up. We use Alexa mostly to play music, though. We have not experimented with much else, except for asking basic information, such as the day's weather or the current temperature outside before heading out. We need to take time to set up our echo dot to do a lot more. There is, however, a lack of time for us to devote to this task (which is probably very simple anyway...).By the way, I like the disk-like shape of this version of the Echo dot much more than the spherical one of the new one.","January 5, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

I can play the everywhere group with all speaker devices recognized.  One stereo pairing to an account, apparently.  Still good, but a little disappointed my Echo network is flawed.

Again adding other devices works super easily. If you have an older forgetful person in your life buy them this! It helps with my meds (ordering AND taking), it helps with my appointments, it helps me get to sleep faster, and it's just my life more fun and helps my caretakers take care of me. Everyone is on the same page AND if I don't use it for a while (I think a day) it tells on me to the people I have set it up with which will prompt them to check up on me! Updating to 5 stars!! I love this product the only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars is that if you are older (as I am) the equipment that you are ""plugging in"" may not be able to do everything that you want. For instance because my TV and Roku are older I cannot just turn on the TV using voice activation and some of us older folks can't really afford to replace all of these items at once. I have two lights and my TV plugged in but still have to use the remote to ""turn on"" the TV. Once I am able to replace my Roku with a newer version then it will all turn on at once with only the voice activation. I love listening to my Spotify playlists, I love all the silly things that you can say that she responds to, all in all it is useful and FUN. I would say if you are buying this for someone as a gift (as was done for me) make sure that you scope out their appliances and confirm that they will be able to use this in the intended manner.  I've had a great time with it and I love how easy it is to turn things off and on on the days that I can't get out of bed!","March 3, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

This does that perfectly, lets me turn off lights, play spotify, and alarms easily. One big thing I enjoyed was the fact you can pair alexa to almost any device that uses wifi controls, I bought some cheap RGB light bulbs and they work well once you setup the app. I will be honest, I didnt buy this it was a family gift, I wouldnt buy it just for this purpose since ur phone can do most of these actions already. I see it as a little gimmicky after awhile of use, but its fun if you have alot of devices connected to it.  If u have a tech savy home with electronic AC controls a or lights that use wifi connection, then it might offer a better experince.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I was given this device by my apartment management as part of a tech upgrade. It was supposed to allow voice control of my thermostat and door lock (both of which were also replaced as part of the upgrade).The big assumption today, I've noticed, that big companies make is that EVERYBODY has a smartphone.I do not.So, there is no way for me to get these devices to interact. There is no pc app, no website help. No plans for that to ever change.Outside of that, what do I think of the device? Well, it is a fun toy.While the audio is high quality, unless you plug it into a stereo sound system it will always be mono. I understand that if you buy a second one they can cooperate to give you a stereo experience. But I am currently hard-pressed to justify owning one.The instruction leaflet that came in the box seems to be minimalist by design to force you to go online in an effort to find out what sort of things it can do. One of the first things you are encouraged to do is install the app on your phone.I still don't have one of those phones.So I settled for installing Alexa on my pc.  Once you do that, It enables your computer to do everything that the Dot can do, plus you can see what you are doing on a screen. Even less justification for keeping the Dot plugged in.Alexa doesn't always hear what I say correctly. And as the device is capable of making purchases on my verbal command, I do live in fear that it might invisibly sign me up to money-draining services I did not ask for.It does have certain preset ""skills"" that, so far, work. I do, however, have a problem with creating a skill online that I want it to have. It just refuses to do it and offers no explanation as to why not.It is supposed to work with other online services (notably Amazon-owned ones), yet I've noticed it is very picky with allowing me to hear certain radio stations in my TuneIn account, but not others.A big annoyance is not being able to find an easily readable definitive source of info that will tell me, at a glance, everything that the device is currently able to do or can do for a price. The first piece of electronic equipment I've ever owned that forces you to dig like an online gopher for any scrap of data you can get. There are manuals available for purchase. I'm just not convinced that I want to spend a penny more on something I already know or is useless for me to know. I'm not somebody who buys a pig in a poke.Bottom line: It is fun to verbally play with. Beyond that it offers me nothing that isn't better handled by my pc.","September 9, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

My friend told me about a great way to get ""her"" on a promotion price and I am definitely pleased that I did it. Didn't know how much I would utilize ""her"" until I got ""her"". ""She"" can hear ""her"" name from a mile away and is always ready to assist you. I have asked ""her"" all kinds of things ""Alexa play ... "" (I set ""her"" up to play my music with Spotify - this includes my created playlist! Score!) ""Alexa what is 1/3 of 3 cups?"" ""Alexa  how do you make lasagna?"" ""Alexa set a timer for 30 mins"" She has come in handy every single time. Playing music out of ""her"" when I'm cleaning is a great alternative to my loud stereo, as that often disturbed my neighbors below me.Two areas of improvement that I can think of:1. There are a few kinks to work out when asking ""her"" certain things and ""she"" goes to the web for reference.2. A catch 22, is how sensitive ""she"" is to hearing ""her"" name. ""She"" has heard my friends say it over the phone, and in a few commercials and immediately woke up. However when I'm in the next room and say ""her"" name and give ""her"" a command without the need to yell or shout, it's so helpful (see the catch 22).Overall I'm so glad I have this Echo Dot. It has been amazing! So yeah, you, go ahead and get it. It fits in the most inconspicuous places and packs a lot of power.Please note: I put all the pronouns in quotes because the echo dot has no gender.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I got this with a Ring Alarm bundle or I would never have bought it. But, I was curious to jump into the Alexa ""echosystem.""My journey started with looking for an alarm system as I live alone and occasionally travel for extended periods of time. I chose the Ring system partly because of my perceived better integration with Alexa (since Amazon did buy Ring, afterall).Current Amazon/Ring setup:Ring basic alarm kitRing spotlight battery camRing Doorbell 2Echo Dot (3rd gen)Echo Show 5Fire Tablet 7 (2019)Fire TV 4K (the short box version that was first to offer 4K, whatever generation that is)Pending additions:Ring Peephole cam (prob swapping out the Doorbell 2)Echo FlexHave my eye on:Echo (3rd gen) or Echo PlusEcho subwooferEcho StudioFire TV Cube (2019)As an Alexa point, the Dot does its job. The mic works and Alexa talks through the speaker.The sound quality is terrible for music. Compared to the Show 5, the Dot is slightly better balanced. The highs sound more tinny on the Show 5, and, while there is ever-so-slightly more bass, the Show 5 is ever-so-slightly more muddy than the Dot. In comparison to a JBL Flip 4 or UE Boom 2, the sound of both the Show 5 and Dot is inferior--and that's saying something because I'm quite disappointed with both the Flip and Boom in regards to price/sound quality (I recommend going with a B+O, Klipsch, Bose, etc. if you are looking for better sound in a similar size package--or maybe the UE Megaboom series in a size larger.).The Dot and Show 5 can be added to multiroom music groups through Alexa. This could be of value if one were to connect them to external speakers via the 3.5mm audio out jack on either device. I intend to do just that with an Echo Flex I have on order.If there were some equalization controls, these could be useful for softer, dispersed through-the-house music, but Amazon/Alexa don't seem to offer such features. That specifically is disappointing when using Amazon Music on my phone bluetoothed to my JBL Flip 4s because when I use Apple Music (which includes some equalizer controls), the JBL Flip 4s become somewhat bearable to listen to.I didn't realize how much I would like having a clock, and for that feature the Show 5 is nice. I haven't had a clock in my house except for the stove and microwave in years. For that feature alone though, I'd like to see the Echo Dot Clock come in charcoal or grey, which I would buy over the non-clock Dot.If you are looking for a device for listening to music without additional external speakers, I'd skip the Dot altogether, opting instead for one of the larger Amazon-branded Alexa devices or a reputable speaker brand device that has integrated Alexa functionality. With external speakers, you have a lot of options amongst the Echo devices, and the Dot could be a contender (cheaper with a deal or bundle maybe?) vs the Input, Flex, or Show devices.","November 23, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

After setting it up and streaming my favorite music, getting the weather, news and being able to get an answer to most of the dumb questions my family can make up, ordered four more. I’ve set them up through the house to use as an intercom, and got one to give to friends. Like a cell phone I don’t know how we lived before having the Echo Dot and wish I had ordered them sooner. I really love it! I have a smart plug coming to see how it interacts with Alexa and play around with it before getting more. I really like that it can be used to make calls—which helps out since we don’t have a landline phone at the house. The units can be paired with Bluetooth speakers and your cell phone can be connected to play music. I haven’t hooked one via the 3.5mm jack to a sound system but may later on for a party or something. It’s handy as an alarm clock and timer too. I like that you can set reminders. Just don’t say the word “buy” around it, stuff will get added to your Amazon shopping cart. Thanks to my mom and brother and I nearly wound with a metal shed and have been trying to train them on how to interact with it. It struggles a little with an Appalachian accent and a deaf parent who has a hard time pronouncing words, we’re working on getting it used to it. It’s definitely worth it and buy several if you get one.

Plus, my daughter loves the stories at night and opening boxes of cats. It’s made my entire life easier. Plus, setting up custom responses from Alexa tailored to my daughter and fiancé is totally fun. I love being able to tell my daughter she’s beautiful and going to have a good day in grade 5 every morning as soon as she wakes up.  The custom skills are totally fun and cute. I love calling everyone to breakfast without having to wash my hands or call my fiancé for coffee before the little one gets up weekends without having to actually yell and wake everyone up. You can set reminders for kids to take out the dog. Or feed them.  In fact, I set up an entire skill to help my daughter take on more responsibility with the dog. She can ask how much food to feed the dog, in case she forgets. She can ask Alexa what to do after or where she can find the dogs toys. Or even what kinds of treats to give the dog and how. The skill is technically for dog walkers or sitters however was extremely easy to tweak into “Cocoas Helper” and my daughter loves using it.  It works as intended, and I can change it as needed and quickly. I just can’t say enough...Alexa has really helped this household. We’ve bonded playing quiz games and mad libs, we’ve created chores and to-dos and, simply was *reminded* to do things I constantly forget like take my vitamins.

We have an older Fire TV device that also has this weighted feel to them and I really like it because they don't feel ""cheap"".Speaking of our Fire TV device...what I found out unexpectedly is because we already have our Fire TV set up I DID NOT have to enter a password for our network when setting up the Echo Dot. Apparently Amazon saves that information when you register/setup ANY of their brand of devices. I don't recall being asked to store that information when I set up the Fire TV so it would have been nice to know ahead of time that they have it and that when being setup/registered (before shipping) that it would also include the stored password. I thought something was wrong with my router or maybe compromised. Once I Googled it and saw that wasn't the case I wasn't so aggravated anymore.One of my kids is special needs and has never spoken as clearly as most people. With that being said Alexa hasn't had many difficulties ""understanding"" what they wanted Alexa to do. Mainly this means asking for songs by various artists and movie soundtracks.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased 3 dots and 1 show to automate things in my home. I have several products from different manufacturers (Ring, Sengled, Schlage, etc.) and I wanted to combine automation in one place instead of accessing different apps every time I wanted to do something.I found Skills and Routines are hit and miss. Even though the skill is available, or the routine allows you to choose options, they are not really supported by the system. Here is an example:I tried to set up my Foyer lights (Sengled) to go on when motion is detected through the motion detector (Ring). I can select all the options in the Routine and if I ""play"" the routine, the end result (lights go on) work.  However the automation doesn't. When the motion detector senses motion, the routine doesn't trigger.I tested this with other items in my household, and although they work separately, they will not interact with each other.  I called technical support and after the rep seemed like a deer on headlights when assisting me, he said he would have to ""research the issue"" and would call me back in 15 minutes or so. Two days later after not receiving a call back, I called again and this time the rep promptly told me that third party devices do not work with each other in routines as that is not supported right now.....big miss!I know technology is not perfect and companies are always working on further develop their products, however this is to me an essential part of an automation device...integrate all functionality with the services/products you support.I have to add that individual automation of devices works well. For example I have lights  outside my house to turn on at dusk and turn off at dawn, or my living room lights to turn off at a certain time of the night.Another issue we have is the communication between devices. I ""drop in"" some times to ask my wife or mother in law questions and 90% of the time the drop-in communication is muffled and they can not understand a word I am saying. It also happens when they initiate communication.  Music sounds pretty good out of the echo devices so I don't think is a speaker issue, and voice commands are recognized no problem so I don't believe is a mic issue either. My WiFi connectivity usually clocks at around 270Mbps so I know it is not my connection.Finally, skills. I created a skill from scratch that would give me a countdown for a trip we will be taking. The skill works great when I interact with Alexa directly. However, once again, Routines leave a lot to be desired. The skill does not even show in my skill list when creating the routine. This doesn't make the feature of skills pointless but once again, the ""automation"" part leaves a lot to be desired.I may edit my review if/when all these functions are implemented, but for the time being I think this product has quite a bit of ""room to grow"".","February 5, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

I want to get some Smart Outlets and see if I can set them up with the Echo. The only thing I would like to do but either it doesn't have the ability or I don't know how to do it, is to modify the voice. It seems muffled. I'd like to be able to clear it up a bit.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I had no idea what I would use this thing for, or if I would use it at all. It was on sale for $5, so I took a small risk. It turns out I use it every day. If I'm watching a ball game, I ask it about stats and get useful answers. If I miss a game, I get answers about what I missed. If I'm watching a movie, I may ask a question about an actor. I ask it to remind me to do stuff during my day working from home. When I go to bed at night, I tell it when to wake me up, and what music I want to hear. I ask it to read me news headlines. Instead of searching the web for every little curiosity I think of during the day, I ask Alexa. If I forget where I put down my phone, Alexa will ring it for me. When my son was visiting, he started asking it stuff too. This tech is very compelling and useful. I plan to buy one for everyone in my family.I think my favorite feature is, ""Alexa, sing me a song."" It sometimes does this rap about Mark Twain that is hilarious and educational. It'll also tell you silly jokes. So it's fun as well as useful. Well worth the price.","September 22, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R
"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Very happy so far. Alexa sometimes will command things on and say they are on but they arent. Rarely but it does happen. The most annoying thing that amazing NEEDS to fix is if you're watching tv and give no commands for let's say about 20mns. When you ask again to turn the tv volume up or down alexa diverts back to her own speakers volume adjustment. ,(1,-10) you then have to say adjust TV volume. Yes 1st would problems I know but it's still annoying. Your tv should be the default volume option at all times. Overall setup is very simple. As soon as you add a new smart device...alexa gets smarter so now I dont even have set it up in the alexa app. As soon as you add the device in its companies app alexa announces she found it and knows the name and everything. This was very impressive. I believe for the money this is an amazing device. I turned my entire appartment into a ""smart"" apartment for around 180 bucks. Now the 2 big ticket items I have left, nest thermostat and smart door lock. These are quite pricey but everything else alexa can control is pretty cheap from bulbs to light strips to smart outlets to tvs even to my samsung robot vacuum! You can set reminders times shopping lists even routines! For example every morning alexa wakes me up to my favorite song and also turns some of the lights on in the house csn even slowly dim them as you wake up to gradually get briter. It's pretty cool stuff. The speaker on it is VERY clear and quite impressive from a disk the size of your palm. Overall and especially if you have a sound system in your house its totally worth it. No need to buy the bigger echos with bigger speakers if you have a sound system in your house font waste the money and go right for this echo dot3!","December 16, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

Device had stopped working briefly a couple of months into 2022 after I ended Prime membership, but started back working. I use it daily for menial tasks like setting alarms, asking the time, turning off lights, etc. About 88% of the time, Alexa recognizes my voice and what is asked of her. Other times I do have to speak at an elevated volume and pause for a bit longer before asking her my question again. Overall, I think the device has been a sound purchase and it does make me chuckle at times to hear her responses. 😊","January 31, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"From the moment you take it out off the box to start interacting, the whole experience is a breeze.The setup was simple and intuitive. The first thing to amuse me was how natural it felt to be talking to a computer right out of the box. I even feel like saying things like “please”, “thanks” or “good morning” is a must (plus Alexa has something good and new to say, every morning).The speakers sounded like I expected and after a few EQ adjustments it could easily fill my whole living room. It is loud and clear enough. Maybe a little bass is missed but hey, it’s a powerful little speaker, don’t be fooled.Alexa is by far the most advanced, reliable and useful virtual assistant out there. I absolutely love the whole experience. Having recipes read out loud can get boring, but Alexa’s commitment to fulfill the task is to behold (see? I am writing like if I am talking about a human).Definitely the Eco Dot most used purpose is and will be music streaming. For that instance, I would like Alexa to be able to play a playlist in shuffle mode. I feel that’s missing. Other thing I find a bit odd is that when a single song is asked, nothing else plays right after it finishes (as would happen if you were listening right on Spotify). Both of these “issues” can be solved by opening Spotify in any of my devices and streaming to EchoDot, no big deal... I would just want the integration to be deeper (since I don’t like Amazon Music).Overall: I am deeply and widely satisfied with my purchase. I feel an Echo Dot is a must have in any house these days. And for the price, it’s absolutely worth it.","September 2, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I've got things set up in groups with only a few things to control right now.  However, Alexa can't seem to figure out how to turn on/off individual items in a group.  I have a TV and Light in my group ""bedroom"".  I say ""Alexa, turn off the bedroom light"" or ""Alexa, turn the light off in the bedroom"" or ""Alexa, Bedroom light off"" and it just turns off everything in the bedroom.  (or both items, w/e).  WHY?????  I can say ""Alexa, turn off/on all the lights"" and it will turn on/off all the lights in my house.  What is so hard about doing that from one group?  I set up a workaround and created a separate group for EACH light, and a group for each room.  Kind of overkill, but it's the only workaround at the moment.  Alexa doesn't like to turn on/off my tv without a group.  I say ""Alexa, turn off My TV"" and it replies ""Do you mean my tv?""  to which I reply, usually, with an exasperated ""YES"" and it replies ""I can't find my tv"".  Then I respond with ""Alexa, why do you hate me?""  or ""Alexa what the eff is wrong with you and why won't you turn on the one device you just asked me if it is the one I wanted?""  SO.  DANG. Frustrating.But, beyond all that, it's been pretty nice to turn on/control Pandora.  I like asking Alexa for Chuck Norris facts.  It's fun getting it to sing and answer silly questions.  Just not ready for prime time, YET.  Though after this long, will it EVER be ready???I want a skill where I can just walk into my room and say ""Bedroom Light"" and it will turn it on if it's off, or turn it off if it's on.  It's not hard.  It already checks the status of the light.  It'd be a single line of code to implement.","November 15, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

But this device has made my life easier. First, I love that I can set one alarm once, and I have to tell alexa to turn it off which helps me get out of bed because it wakes me up more than swiping the alarm off on my phone. I've been trying to wake up early and right away everyday. With my phone I always put it back down and went back to sleep. But with Alexa I must speak.2) I love that you can do it all literally even when your not near the device. Make shopping lists, grocery lists, schedules, etc. You don't have to remember any of it or write it down. Just say Alexa show me shopping list or schedule, etc. Alexa tells you what's on there. If you are not near your device you can access all of this on the app on your phone.3) I don't have any smart devices connected with it so I won't comment on how that works.4) You can have alexa start and end your day the way you want and on a happy note, by playing sounds, reading news ,etc. It works really well and helps get my day going.5) You can play music on there and its really loud and good quality which is surprising. I have been looking for a good speaker to play loud and good quality music. Bose is too expensive, beats suck, and I even bought a big one for $400, and its loud but the quality sucks. But this little speaker is loud and has good quality. For the price is sounds like a small Bose one.6) It feels sturdy and strong, not cheap and looks very nice on a desk.

Hopefully, it will ""learn"" to understand phrases better through use.  What really irritates me is that I added a smart plug, but you cannot set up things like having the plug turn on and off at a certain time simply by using Alexa's voice command.  You have to go through some rather cumbersome steps on the Alexa app to do this.  You should be able to say, ""Alexa.  Set timer on plug""  but she doesn't understand!

So there are still some basic voice commands that need improving.February 2020I'm adding to my previous review because now I own three Echo Dots, one is the version with the digital clock.  Once you've hooked up one Echo, adding additional ones are even easier.  The single disappointment is that they do not all work together -- and I have no idea why this can't be an option.  There are only two things you appear to be able to do where they all work at once:  You can use them as an intercom to record and play an announcement.  You can select Amazon music to play on all of them (however, you MUST make this selection on the Alexa app.  You can't do this with a voice command!)  I would like to hear my calendar, reminders, alarms, etc on all of them at the same time.  Apparently, that is not possible.","January 4, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R
"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve kind of been resisting the whole smart home thing. Every day almost I’ve been on multiple computers and phones, used cameras and equipment, joined teleconferences, done software updates, used how many apps, touched how many communication devices, used smart printers, smart scanners, smart washer and dryer, read emails and booked appointments, the list goes on and on! The last thing i want to do at the end of the day is use another device (I probably sound like a crotchety old woman but I’m under 35 lol).I have a google home mini my brother gave me for Christmas and I’ve used it (mostly to play music since it sounds pretty decent think) but i really hate how I HAVE to connect my phone to the WiFi and control most things from the google home app (which is not very intuitive in my opinion and feels kind of limited).It’s possible that I only even tried the echo dot because I couldn’t resist the deal of getting it on Black Friday for 19 bucks along with the smart bulb. But I am so glad I did.- It’s SO MUCH better than the google mini and I have already been using it for more things than the mini.- It sounds excellent in my opinion and I have it in my master bathroom where I can listen while in the shower also with loud overhead fan going.- Alexa understands everything single thing I have asked/said.- Doesn’t seem like it creepily thinks I’m talking to it when I’m not like my google mini does all the time.- I don’t have to have my phone anywhere near me to use it which is great- so darn affordable and I think it pretty much set itself up I can’t even recall having to do anything beside plug it in lolWhat can I say that hasn’t already been said?I want another for upstairs","December 21, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I said I would never buy an Alexa but here I am converted. I have one in the car, at work and my mom swears the one I bought for them is for when I go over. This Alexa was my first one 8 months ago.  I did a lot of research and decided on gen 3. It still works great. There was definitely a learning curve for someone who had never really used something like this, I never use Siri either. But as I’ve learned what she’s capable of it’s been so much help while I’m in the house. Play music, read an article, add something to your grocery list, remind you to water the plants  :-)I don’t have any problem with her voice recognition normally. If my music is on really loud and I’m a little far away, she may not hear me so I have to shout or get closer. But it has to be loud. I have a 1 bedroom apartment and I thought I needed 2 but she’s in a pretty centralized location and I can control her from anywhere in the apartment.Her sound quality is great. I’m not a sound expert, but as I mentioned earlier I sometimes play my music pretty loud and it doesn’t distort. Sound is still great.The only integration device I ended up purchasing (which I said I would never) are smart plugs. Alexa works great with them. To be able to get in bed and ask Alexa to turn of a light you left on is such a guilty pleasure.","March 18, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the concept and the device! As a family we have so much fun with Alexa and the Echo Dots. At first we were hesitant to purchase one and didn't think it would be worth the cost, but we were pleasantly surprised! In fact, because we enjoyed our initial one so much, we purchased several more for different rooms in our house as well as for gifts!Since we have several Echo Dots, we are able to link them as an intercom system and ""drop in"" on another room to talk to each other, which is a neat feature and can also be very entertaining! This cuts down on yelling across the house when dinner is ready! You can also use this feature from your phone when you are away from your home. Sound and range is great, especially considering it's compact size. Music sounds just as good from this little speaker as it did from a larger speaker we had that was double the cost!The kids have thoroughly enjoyed the various free games (Akinator is our favorite!), and asking Alexa random questions. We use the timer, alarm, reminder, & flip a coin features all the time for various daily tasks and check the weather forecast and temperature every morning to prepare for the day.Overall, we are extremely pleased with our Echo Dot devices. The only thing we have had an issue with is sometimes Alexa is not as responsive on the Dot in the same room, but picks up on the Dot in the adjacent room and further away. Setting a particular Dot to the primary device did not seem to make a difference. This issue can be frustrating when trying to play music or when playing a game. Alexa gets a little confused when given commands sometimes, but majority of the time the Echo Dot functions as expected. Overall we are satisfied with the product and would still recommend it despite these issues.","February 7, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

I think cause of this my dots have a hard time to figure out which one I am talking to cause the voice carries in the house.I will have the one in the bathroom upstairs answer me instead of the kitchen downstairs.I also sometimes try to find the words to ask her something and she would try to answer right away and not understand what I’m trying to ask (I have speech problems so it’s hard). You have to be very specific on what you need.I would love to see a way to change settings to accommodate speech problems so she gives us more time to try to talk. With stuttering and other speech issues it would be nice to have a moment to try to get out what your trying to ask.The shopping list is great, I love just telling her to add it to my list. That way when I’m low or out I can put it on the list right away and not forget about it.I also love just the fun stuff you can ask. My husband constantly loves asking her to play annoying stuff and some of the ones we actually laugh and request again just cause they are funny or fun.She does routines, trivia, alarms, and so much more.

I bought each one a different time. Of course I trusted Amazon products were going to work at least 3 years minimum but guess what, all 3 of the devices are not working again at the moment.I called tech support last night and did the reset with all the other things I needed to do. Well the tech support was talking about a discount which I assume if I call back they offer me that. Yet I can't buy all those 3 devices right now and can't buy without the monthly payments. They don't have that on none of those devices now.I knew I should have bought the extended warranty but I didn't and being poor on disability I wasn't able to do that.

Hubby wasn't too happy about it at first, but he has just as much playing the games on it as the kids and I do. I bought 2 of them...one is in my bedroom and the other is in the kitchen. So when we are cooking dinner or having a party, we can ask Alexa to play music and she gets loud enough to be heard a little bit outside. I also get started in the morning by asking for the weather and the time...and also asking her to play some of my favorite jams. I regret nothing. I also like the fact I can drop in and listen to what is going on at home while I am away at work or out of town. And also, the fact that messages can be sent through her and she reads them aloud is AMAZING. The only thing I do not really like is the fact that, even though I have set up voice recognition only to my voice, anyone can ask her to do something..so I set up the password so nothing can be ordered without it. I will be ordering more soon to put through the rest of my home though. I have anxiety and depression so the music soothes me when i have flare ups as well. I haven't used the reminders yet, but I did use the alarm feature once, and it worked great. I don't like how the light flashes all hours of the night though on some features..so if you wanted to listen to relaxing sounds or music to help you sleep better then you would need a sleeping mask.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well for a lot of things, I'd set alarms, listen to music, turn on and off my lights, all with a very easy setup. The voice recognition worked really well at first but after maybe a month it felt like I had to speak a little louder for it to hear me, most likely a problem on my end though.Sometimes I try asking it random questions to look up online and it almost never gives me something useful. ""Hey Alexa, how do you craft a pickaxe in Minecraft?""  and Alex would respond with ""Minecraft was created in 2011 and is the number one highest grossing game in the world"".With it connected to amazon though, and with the amount I order off amazon, the feature of her being able to track your packages or giving a little notification when delivered was super nifty and saved me having to go through all these different menus and screens on the app/website.Also the functionality of my light is pretty good, doesnt allow me to go to a color shifting mode, but just turning on and off and setting the brightness is pretty good. Music playing was also pretty good with the usual kinks of artists with weird names and alexa thinking I said something way different to what I actually said, I just have to spell the artists name out and that fixes it.Overall she's a very nifty device I find myself using a lot more often than I expected and there's still things I'm figuring out about her that I think will boost my usage of her throughout the years.","December 13, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I can't stand this anymore.  It's like torture.  It seems Amazon is purposely trying to make Alexa as annoying as humanly possible.  Add an item to your grocery list and it now tells you bought repeatedly.  For mayonnaise.  WHO CARES.  SHUT UP ALREADY.  It NEVER stops talking even though I have it on ""brief"" mode.Everything now is what you ask for but it adds ""By the way..."" and tells you some other lame garbage you HAVE to listen to.Imagine a light switch or door knob or electrical outlet that argues with you and interrupts you constantly, and talks loudly and for prolonged periods when you need it to be quiet (like when you hear a strange sound outside your house at night in the dark).  That's Amazon Echo.I'm updating this now at the end of January 2022 because now when you say something as simple as ""Alexa/Echo/Computer, play classical music,"" instead of just playing it now tries to let you know there's a new album of some classical composer's work and you can subscribe to Amazon's music service -- blah, blah, blah, ALWAYS talking instead of just DOING.""You don't control this.  It controls you.And if you think you're just adding an item to your groceries list, think again.  I'm sure there's an associate file at Amazon keeping tabs on what you but, how often, and so on, and that that too will get more invasive (and argumentative) in time.Cumulatively all of these issues plus the ongoing privacy concerns, and this is definitely leaving me looking into alternatives.I might have been curious about adding Echo to my driving experience, but is that going to be just as non-stop talkative (and argumentative) WHILE you're DRIVING?  No thanks.Amazon is going down a design rabbit hole.  If CONSTANTLY pissing off customers is the goal, congratulations, you've succeeded.This is exactly what happened with other online sites such as auction sites.  You could easily and quickly list things and turn them into cash, but month after month some techie and manager had to justify their jobs and salaries so instead of being a streamlined experience those products because extremely time consuming to use and no longer justified listing items unless they justified your time spent in getting them sold.  That's exactly what's happened with Amazon.I just wanted something so I could go into a room and turn on multiple lights at once, and turn them off.  Or turn them on when I'm not home so it looks like I am.  The music was fine when you could say something like ""play classical"" and it said only what station or playlist it was playing and then the music started.  Now it's truly invasive and blatantly designed not to serve you, but to give you enough utility that you'll put up with constant ads and pushes for more and more and more.I'll turn on my own damned lights all around the room before I'll put up with and submit to normalizing THIS.Does Dyson sell a vacuum cleaner that argues with you and interrupts you and suddenly announces for no reason in the middle of the night that it's connected to your iPhone?  No.Imagine using a KitchenAid mixer that argued with you and interrupted when you're juggling two parts of a recipe and with critical timing.  That's what Amazon's Echo is like.  Just when you think it can't get more argumentative and invasive, it does.George Orwell got 1984 wrong.  People will submit willingly to Big Brother in the name of convenience.  What Amazon fails to understand, is that's only true up to a point, and the entire Amazon Echo experience has jumped the shark.There's got to be a better alternative out there and I'm determined to find it and get this unwanted, never shutting up ""houseguest"" out of my life for good.Enough!","October 28, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",1.0 out of 5 stars,"O.k. I had NO IDEA that the Echo Dot could work all on its own! I thought that you had to have a base Alexa unit, and the dots were just add-ons. Nope! I was recently at a BBQ and they were entertaining the birthday guests with the Echo Dot! Alexa even sang Happy Birthday to the birthday girl! How crazy is that? The host had the Echo Dot connected to this really cool Bluetooth speaker and it sounded great in the backyard, in fact, they had to keep turning it down because people were yelling over the music!After the party I was sold and had to go home and order my own Echo Dot! It is insane how much this little device can do! You can ask Alexa anything and she will come up with an answer from google. Very rarely does she not have an answer for your question. She will tell you jokes, weather, news, etc. You can set timers, alarms, add items to your grocery/to do list, or control your smart T.V. without even picking up the remote!The Echo Dot sounds phenomenal. For the small size (about the size of your palm) this thing can put out a lot of sound! and if you are trying to be quiet , you can whisper to Alexa and she will whisper back to you! You can tell Alexa to play a specific song, or a genre of music and rock out for hours. You can make hands free calls to your loved ones!I am in love with my new Echo Dot and will be purchasing more for other rooms in the house (you can even sync music and notifications to all of the dots throughout your house!)My one complaint about the Echo Dot is the length of the cord.

It has guard, and home mode which is my #1 favorite thing when comparing it to the Nest Mini.Another thing I love on the Alexa itself is the mute button at the top including the + , - volume buttons and the push to speak! In which, the Google Nest Mini do not have. The mute button is on the rear side on Google’s.I like how they went with the all circle colors.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my first Alexa, so I decided to go with the basic model.  It was very easy to set up.  I am also using it with one smart plug to operate a lamp which Alexa can turn on when I ask her to, or I can turn it on with my Alexa app.  Alexa’s voice recognition is good.  I order a lot from Amazon and Alexa likes to display a rotating green light to signal to me that she has a “notification” that one of my packages has arrived.  Just ask:  Alexa, do you have mortifications for me?  Otherwise, we’re really just using Alexa for fun—to play music, give us the weather, or to ask her silly questions just to see how she answers.  I was also able to add my husband to my Amazon account so that Alexa will recognize his voice by name as well.  This was all pretty easy and we’re having fun with Alexa.  Now I need to figure out ways to make her more useful...like clean the house.UPDATE:  Just bought a second Alexa for our vacation home.  Love that you can connect two Alexas to your account.  Also love that I can use my Alexa app to get Alexa to control a smart device in the *other* house.  Like turn on or off the Christmas lights in the *other* house.I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases.  I do that because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.  I hope that my review helped you.","January 29, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

Two, from time to time, I have to do a factory reset because it stops responding and then that causes some issues with my whole house audio. But once the reset is done, life goes on.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love the physical device (Echo Dot Gen 3), but the WiFi set up was a big pain. Amazon customer service was unable to help me fix the issue. After several calls with Amazon's tech support, explaining that Alexa would not accept my correct password, they recommended I call my internet provider. They didn't know the solution, either. Eventually, I went into my WiFi router's control panel and found a ""WPA passphrase"" which - when I entered it in the Alexa set-up process - solved the issue. It took about a week to get my Alexa working. Amazon should have been aware of this issue and the fix for it.I am happy with it now, though some of the voice responses feel disappointingly corny or unnatural (e.g., I don't want the voice to say ""You bet!"" or ""Anytime"" when I make the mistake of saying ""Thank you"" to a non-sentient computer.) I know this AI is evolving and look forward to better voice dialogue.","September 17, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,After my Gen 1 echo dot became damaged I waited a bit to buy a new one.  After seeing the gen 3 on sale I decided to go for it. I am glad I did.  The build quality is amazing. Not that the first generation was bad.  The fit and finish of cloth and plastic is impressive.The most amazing part is the sound quality.  I had been using an older sound blaster Roar as the speaker.  While that product worked the shelf I had it on was small plus the volume control on the roar is horrible. While the echo dot gen 3 is smaller and less sophisticated than the roar the sound quality is very impressive for what it is.The compact footprint allows you to place this nearly anywhere.  The bass is actually pretty good if you set it up correctly.  The mids are a bit low but if you compensate using an equalizer it's a bit better. You can push it pretty hard without distortion.  Voice recognition is close to perfect.  The LED is visible from wide angles which is very important to me.  From across the room with my fan on I can issue commands and see and hear the response.The unit is noticably larger and heavier than the Gen 1.  The power adapter has been changed from 5 volt USB to a 12 volt barrel connector.  I take it this is to support the larger speaker and and amplifier.Very happy with this and plan to buy a few more.,"September 4, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

Conclusion; in the lineup oflike devices Amazon is definitely the leading contender but when your in a class of useless gimmicks your still just a gimmick. Just my opinion and it's based on the simple fact I can do everything and more with my phone without am echo device and save myself 50 bucks. Lastly, I have google fiber service and never have issues for the most part and it's wicked fast however my dot has the worst connection of any device obhave ever connected to it.

Music is awesome of course you have to have a subscription, its cheap but I have so many, I hated to add another but the convivence of it all is so worth it if you listen to music a lot you can of course create your own playlist all by voice command .

We find that we use them most for weather, making a shopping list, and a radio equivalent, even playing an NPR station from the location 1000 miles away where we used to live.  Recently we bought coordinating light bulbs and like that feature a lot, especially in a room with no overhead.  Now I don't have to cross the room in the dark to turn a light on--I can just ask Alexa.  I haven't yet figured out how to play music on both so we have a 2-room sound system.

We held off because we didn't want a device ""listening"" to us all the time in our home. At least, that was our reasoning. But then we thought about it -- we have four smartphones between us and we use Google Assistant all the time.So we took the plunge when Amazon had a deal on the device and it's awesome. My children love asking Alexa to play their favorite songs.... over and over and over. I'm learning how to use some of the Alexa routines (skills?). My wife still isn't much of a believer and is suspicious of it, but for her there is a button that prevents the Echo from listening to you -- complete with a red ring light to show that it's not listening. (Or is it just pretending not to listen?) Haha. Anyway, it's fun for music and the speaker is pretty decent. You can add an external speaker if that's your thing.OH, P.S. I Love love love the ""whisper"" mode. You whisper to Alexa and she whispers back. Perfect for setting wakeup alarms after everone has gone to sleep.I'm going to get more of these.TWO COMPLAINTS:-Alexa isn't as good at searching the web as Google Assistant (go figure!), but the voice recognition is friendlier and more accurate in my opinion.-Alexa seems to ""pitch"" things for you to do with it, or buy through it, or services to add on. It's like having a perosnal assistant who like to try to get you to upgrade every now and then.Still, pretty cool. I'm sold. Pair with Amazon Music unlimited and it's super useful.","June 4, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R
"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"ECHO devices now create their own little insecure network for a feature called Sidewalk.  Yes, Sidewalk steals part of your broadband data.  Yes, you can turn off Sidewalk.  But beware!  If you turn off sidewalk, All of your echo devices within earshot will respond to your commands.  I contacted help and they told me I could use different wake words for each of my devices to fix the problem.  Great, I have four devices on my first floor and they want me to remember which wake word goes with which device?This is unacceptable!  I just got comfortable enough with Amazon to get annual subscriptions to Prime and Music Unlimited.  Those will be cancelled and my Echo devices thrown in the trash.Update:  After vigorous complaints to Amazon and sending emails to various tech writers explaining my experience, unplugging all but my Echo Studio devices and then plugging them back in, the proximity function is working again with Sidewalk disabled.  This makes me happy but I am NOT pleased that Amazon would add a function that could potentially expose my network without my notifying me.  I understand that they did quite a bit to mitigate against hacking but WIFI and Bluetooth are inherently insecure to begin with.  I have decided to keep my Amazon Prime and Unlimited accounts because everything is working normally again.  But my fuse will be EXTREMELY short if Amazon tries to add this type of feature without notifying me and providing a WORKING way to disable it.","December 9, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"First off, the speaker on this thing sucks, so don't get your hopes up of filling any room with groundbreaking sound.  If you want to do that, you need the $400 speakers paired with a subwoofer which are pretty decent unless you are an audiophile like me.  However, the dot does have its perks:  its very small, its cheap, and it does all the functions of any other Amazon Alexa device (except the Show decides with a screen), and the best part is you can hook it up to a huge speaker or AV Receiver with just an AUX cable to work magic.  I have mine hooked up to an incredible home theater system that makes it possible to add it to groups so it plays in sync with all my other Amazon speakers and subwoofers I have around my house and its worth the $35 for sure.  So with that setup, I can say ""Alexa, play [music] on everywhere group (or whatever group) and it will incorporate a $4500 Klipsch home theater with my other speakers and turn my house into a nightclub.

For my hue lights I like  motion detectors also Philips Hue Smart Dimming Kit.Once you set up your home with motion detectors and door sensors. Like for example opening my closet door the light automatically comes on or when we walk into the bathroom the lights automatically come on because the motion sensor turns them on.  After having these automations with motion detectors and door sensors voice seems kind of an extra step that is not even needed.I do think the best thing that I have found to use the echo and Google hub  devices for is in the kitchen to set timers for when your hands are not able to touch a screen.

Great product except I bought this to play music to fall asleep to, there's no real ""happy place"" at low volume, if setting it to where I can hear it comfortably to fall asleep to, it'll kick the volume up a notch randomly, then drop back down on its own.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I use by Echo devices primarily to control desk and table lamps and an oscillating fan. I have really gotten use to having several of these things scattered throughout the house - so much so that I now get irritated every time the power fluctuates enough to trip the routes they are connected to so that they no longer respond. I can now operated lights even if I have a ton of stuff in my hands as it only takes a few words. I also like having most of the lamps and the bedroom fan attached to plugs controlled by Alexa so that if I forget to turn something off at bedtime, I don't have to get out of bed to turn devices anywhere in the house off. With severe arthritis and neuropathy, I really  appreciate that.There are times that I am frankly amazed at it's voice recognition abilities. Sometimes, especially in the morning, I'm not sure I'm even making sounds and Alexa will perform the desired task and there is no problem at all in understanding what Alexa says.Alexa's integration into things like the TV and AV receiver and music services is decent, or maybe I'm too much of an old fossil to quickly learn how to use it to control these sorts of things. As of now, I still rely mainly on the hand-held remotes to control such devices. I would think that most problems in this area lie with their manufactures who developed the apps rather the Echo which attempts to use them.All in all, I am very pleased with my Echo devices. They are fun and very useful around the house.","June 13, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

If I want to request certain songs, I have to ""buy"" the program.  I am not happy about that.

This my second echo dot and I am still amazed every day with the amount of features it has. Now with a dot at each end of my house, I can listen seamlessly when moving from kitchen to my office and not have to pause the book until I return to the front of my house. Having unlimited access to the weather, recipes, jokes, someone to do math for me, and other online info is also a life changing experience. One of my favorite things about Alexa, is that someone finally got the voice right! I have been blind for 25 years and I have had the opportunity to listen along with the progression of more and more life like digital voices. There have been times where I have avoided using certain types of media because the computer voicing was so bland, stiff or hard to understand that it ruined the experience. Alexa on the other hand just sounds like a person and that makes all the difference. I am now able to purchase and enjoy a .99 Kindle book instead of having to pay upwards of $24.99 for an audio book from an unknown author that may/or may not be worth the risk. At some point I most likely will have one of these devices in every room of my house.","April 22, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,Alexas voice recognition is decent. Only thing that annoys me is the constant promos for Amazon prime and music. It repeats itself when I go back to songs I’ve requested. I’m already a member and have Amazon unlimited music so thats irritating. Also trying to find certain albums or artists has been difficult. It keeps suggesting the same thing and sometimes misunderstands my voice. I honestly just use Alexa for my cat. When I leave home or when she needs to relax I play the same music or genre like meditation. I have a favorite which is called “Relax my cat” also it’s pretty annoying that you can’t integrate YouTube. I get it. It’s an Amazon product but you can integrate with other apps. You have to pair up the echo dot with your phone to play music from YouTube. That’s the only way to stream music on YouTube. Also every time I turn on my phone and/or laptop echo dot is already connected. I can’t connect it manually it just does it on its own. I’m not going to lie I haven’t really sat down to figure out how the features work or the echo dot as well and honestly I do not feel it’s user friendly for those who aren’t tech savvy. That’s just my opinion. Other than that my cat loves this 😂😂😂 and I’m grateful for this. She’s a spazz at times so this really helps. I leave it on for her overnight and when I run my errands. 🙏🏽💕💜🤓,"January 19, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"After having had a Google Home Mini for about a year, but not being super impressed with it i figured i'd try the deal Amazon had to get an Echo Dot for $1 with a music subscription. Unfortunately i was entirely unimpressed with both.After setting up my dot, and linking it to the smart bulbs in my living room, i tried seeing what Alexa could do. Turns out, not much. Not only did it not understand the sample commands printed in the scant instruction book or Alexa app like ""Alexa, set lights to Green"", when it DID decide to actually do something, it would only control ONE bulb at a time.""OK"" I thought ""Lets see how it handles my new Music Unlimited sub."" Again, VERY poorly. There were a few albums worth of music already in the account, added automatically based on CDs i had ordered in the past (very nice feature BTW) so i asked Alexa to play some specific songs. Pretty much every single attempt was a complete dud. So next i tried getting Alexa to play my favorite podcast. Again, near complete failure. It took the dot multiple attempts to figure out i was asking for a podcast, and NOT a song with a similar title, despite me adding the word ""podcast"" in first at the beginning, then the end, and once, not at all. 4th time was the charm apparently, and i finally manged to get Alexa to play the podcast i wanted. Turns out though, that you can't request a specific episode, or episode title.Finally, i decided to try setting up a routine, something simple. I set up a hypothetical morning wake up routine, where Alexa would turn on my lights and ramp the brightness up to 100% over 5 minutes (something basic, front and center in the menu), and noticed that for some reason you couldn't set a color this way. Okay, white it is i guess. I also wanted Alexa to play a song as well. Well, turns out there's no option to ramp the volume on a song up, at least not in a normal way that i could see. So instead of setting up ONE routine that started about 5 minutes before i got up, and slowly increased in intensity, i had to make TWO routines. One for lights, and a second for the music 5 minutes later.I turned off my smart lights (not via switch, but via app, gotta have actual power to the things for them to work after all) and waited for the routine to kick in. At the appointed time when my living room lights were supposed to come on, imagine my surprise when only ONE light comes on. About 45 seconds later the second light finally comes on. BOTH lights are at around 75% brightness. Now, silly me i had assumed that the lights would start at basically off and go from there, gradually. Nope, almost fully bright, then every minute or so ONE bulb would suddenly click a few degrees brighter, followed by the other 30-40 seconds later.It's at this point i should mention that you cant set an entire room's worth of lights to do anything other than be on or off. So i couldn't just, say, have my entire Living Room group turn the lights on, then ramp up. No, that would be too useful. INSTEAD, you have to set each device INDIVIDUALLY. So i had to set the turn on at a set time, then ramp up in brightness over a period of time for one bulb, then do the same for the other.When it was time for the music to kick in, it decided ""Screw it, who cares if you set it to play from the Echo Dot. Let's play from the phone instead."" Literally every step of a very simple routine was an absolute failure.For being on the 3rd generation of Echo Dot the thing is pretty much like a beta-test product. The Alexa app is borderline useless, integrates poorly with the Echo Dot, and functions erratically when it DOES decide to try working.","May 17, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

When Echo works, it can be quite convenient.  The set up process for each device is a bit of a pain as every manufacturer is a little different and wants you to use their app.  That wouldn't be so bad, but be aware, my experience is that I have to re-set up my devides every month.  Not the same ones mind you.  Sometimes it is the Gosund plugs, then the Sengled lights, or Cync, or another one I forget now.  In retrospect, buying all the exact same manufacturer plugs and lights would likely help, but in theory, all this is supposed to be easy, and it is...until I go through my monthly or more often re-setup.  And, don't forget that if your internet goes down, Echo shuts down also  One would think that would only disable the info features, but nope, Alexa does nothing if she can't talk to the internet.  All your convenience disappears.  The intercom aspect is handy, and overall, I like the features and use Alexa daily.  I also end up cursing Alexa almost daily when I am fighting with it to understand a phrase, repeating myself, doing re-setups, etc.  At some point, a lot of this will likely be worked out.  Just be aware we are not there yet and you should be tech-friendly, as I am, or I imagine this will be nightmarishly difficult.","December 7, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"So I finally broke down and entered the world of “smart” speakers. Got tired of the wiring mess with my 5.1 system. Having to try to integrate a surround system with a Firetv Stick. Have 3 different remotes to run all and have the wife keep up and use it all confidently.I purchased 3 of these and an echo sub. I tied two with the echo sub and a 4K Firetv Stick. “Theater”.Setup was actually pretty easy. Had it all up and going in about 15 minutes once the speakers had updated to the latest firmware.Sound wasn’t too bad......but it was not what I needed for my main TV watching area. The sub helped tremendously but the system sounded well, just not what I wanted. I also purchased two echo 3rd gen speakers and WOW! Much better. (Reviewed under those speakers).I did however, order 3 more of the dots as well (6 total). I installed one in our master bathroom, master bedroom, garage and 40’X50’ building. For listening to music in the background they work pretty well. Setup is a breeze. I have 3 different “groups”.As far as sound, I will say they aren’t terrible. Much better than a couple of other blue tooth speakers I have. Obviously the small size limits the bass, but they will fill an area for listening. There is no comparison to the echo 3rd gen or echo plus but common sense should tell anyone that.They’re great for certain situations and places. For the price (on sale at $19-$22 ea.) they’re pretty good. Not sur if I’ll buy more of these or just wait for the echo 3rd gen’s to go back on sale and buy those.Still......NOT BAD little speakers!","December 26, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is really more a review of Alexa than of the Echo Dot. The Echo Dot is a decent speaker. For it's price, I'd even go so far as to call it a good speaker. But if you're like me, you're really buying the Dot so that it can host Alexa and turn your house into a ""smart house."" DON'T BOTHER.Alexa is dumb. Really dumb. And you can't even teach her to be smart, because basic if-then logic is completely beyond her. The programming is entirely set up for ""when"" commands. For example, you can program her to wake you up WHEN it is 6 AM.  But you can't program her to wake you up only IF you are at home. So if you go on vacation, your wake up routine will run, turn on all your lights, raise the thermostat in your house and so on and so forth EVEN THOUGH Alexa knows you're not at home. She knows your location, she'd just not smart enough to use it.Unless you've seen the skill you want to use EXPLICITLY displayed in a commercial, assume that she cannot do it.  Even if you have seen the exact skill you want, you should assume that it will not work as smoothly as shown. You can program a wake up routine, but you can't tell Alexa, ""Run my wake up routine at 6 AM tomorrow instead of 5:30 AM."" No, you have to go in and manually change the programming.  You can't program her to something every other Friday, only every Friday like clockwork or not at all.Here's a short list of things Alexa doesn't do:*Take action only IF something is true. NO if-then functionality at all.*Alter routines*Do tasks on a non-weekly schedule. NO every-other week, no once-a-month, no second-tuesday.*Play music for 30 minutes and then switch off.  Or do anything at all after playing music. Once the Echo Dot starts playing, Alexa is done.*Do a task at a repeated interval (i.e.: Announce the time every 10 minutes)*Play a shuffled playlist as part of a program or routine.*Ask you a question.  Seriously, she can't use any info you give her to take an action. It's dumb.*Regurgitate basic facts you've asked her to remember.*Lock the front door, even when it's a smart lock with an app and everything.Understand, we didn't just roll over and accept defeat.  I'm an engineer. Writing Excel programs is a significant part of my job description. I spend my days beating computers into submission and tricking them into all sorts of things they don't want to do. I was not about to accept that Amazon was dumb enough to put their brand name on a program and interface as monumentally stupid as Alexa was appearing to be. Surely, there was something I was missing. Surely, there was a way to make things work.I started by looking for skills, but didn't really see any that looked like what I wanted. So I went over to skill builder. Still no luck. So I escalated again, and went to the skill builder section intended for large companies. I thought, ""I'm an engineer. I program all day. I can handle it."" Except that apparently, ALEXA can't handle it. Even in the basic, backdoor coding of ""skills,"" available for high-dollar companies trying to build skills for Alexa to use, you can't use conditional statements. No if-then loops. No while loops. Alexa just doesn't function that way.I have depression. I have a roommate with executive dysfunction, one with ADHD and one with Autism. We all pitched in to get the Dot, as well as a bunch of other things to make the house a ""smart house."" Lights, thermostat, plugs, everything. No holds barred.  We were really hoping that Alexa would be able to help us with various basic tasks that we find difficult to manage for one reason or another. We were hoping that this new technology could help make us more functional. We spent all weekend installing the ""easy install"" light switches and thermostat.  We were so excited to get it all programmed and running. In the end, we were monumentally disappointed. The only reason we haven't returned everything is that pulling it all back out of the walls is quite literally more than any of us can handle.I can't believe Amazon has released this product/program and is actively associating their name with it. I can't believe that Alexa has been on the market as long as it has and is still this dumb. If-then statements are the most basic building blocks of programming. How, HOW do you release a program that's intended to be customized, and NOT include basic if-then logic capability?tl;dr - if you want a speaker that will announce the time on command, buy this echo dot. If you want it to make your life easier, give it a pass. At least until Alexa can understand something as simple as ""Alexa, if no one is home, turn off the lights.""","February 17, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

Nonetheless I love it It really surprised me it was a gift and the sound really surprised me I wish I could change the name Alexa not a fan of it I wish I could change the voice even more so because I'd like it to have a British accent just because I like it!

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I don’t sleep well so I bought this device for Christmas to put in my bedroom and I use it for the sleep sounds feature, which I love.Now about this device. There are things I like about this product and things I don’t. The one thing that I’m not so keen about is the size. It’s about the size of a hockey puck or if you held it in your hands it would probably be the size of a single McDonald’s cheeseburger. I’m also not so sure how I feel about the texture. It’s weird that surroundings all the edges of this product is a fuzzy or carpet like material. But even with that said, I really like it!I especially like this device app features! I have kids at home and sometimes they don’t pick up the phone at the house so it is great that one of the device app features allows me to drop in on that room or I can call my device. I also think another amazing feature is that this device has voice recognition. 95% of the time not only does it recognize my voice but it can recognize my eight-year-old. The 5% when it doesn’t recognize someone’s voice is really bazaar because the device seems to need that person to speak with a deeper voice, slow down the pace of there speech or speak more clearly.All in all, so far it sounds and is working great.","February 21, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R
"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Let me first say that my Ring Security system is AWESOME!  I purchased the 14-pc kit plus several additional components from Amazon totaling roughly $420.00 because I have a very large house.  Installed the system and got it online perfectly without a hitch through the Ring App.  The progress suddenly came to a grinding halt when I downloaded the Amazon Alexa app that supposedly works to tie the Echo Dot to the Ring Account.  It does not.  In the Amazon Alexa App, you select 'menu, skills & games, magnifying glass, enter ring, then Enable to Use.'  This series of entries navigates you to the Ring Login screen where you enter your Ring account login information.  Upon hitting enter to log in, the screen just pops back to a blank login screen where you just keep re-entering the login information without success.  I was on the phone with Amazon tech support from 1030 a.m. to 1:37pm (no lie!!)  but they could not resolve the problem.  They transferred me back and forth asking me the same stupid troubleshooting questions over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I finally gave up.  Planning to box up this Echo Dot and call it a day.  Hope this saves you some headache.  Ring Security is great, but the Echo Dot clearly does not work with it.  12/31/2019 - Update:  My Alexa / Ring login problem is now fixed!  One of the many CSRs I had spoken with previously suggested opening a ticket with the Amazon developers to see if they could get the two accounts to link.  Problem is solved and my Echo Dot is now working perfectly.","December 28, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this unit to compare the functionality of Alexa versus Google, of which I already have several devices. So far I've seen that it definitely has better long range hearing, as in it can actually hear you from across the room, and given the LED strip around the edge, it seems to actually be able to figure out a pretty accurate direction on where you're talking to it from. It also understands commands better than Google, though granted it can't do everything. Right now I have it mounted to the wall next to my stereo, and I used to have it hooked up to the stereo by 3.5mm aux port, but due to some issues with that it's just linked to the stereo by Bluetooth now. When connected by 3.5mm, songs will suddenly stop playing through the stereo, but the Alexa app says they're still going, and it seems like the only fix is to skip or restart the song. Bluetooth does not have this problem, however if I had some suggestions for software updates in the future, they'd be this: when the Echo is linked to a stereo either by Bluetooth or aux port, ALL the audio comes through the aux device, even Alexa just answering questions. I'd suggest putting in an option for the Echo to have regular Alexa voice come through its own speakers and music go through the aux device, at least giving the user a choice to choose from. I'd also suggest if that option became available, that the Echo lets Bluetooth linked devices and stereos sleep when inactive, and when given the command to play media, gives the wake command to the device before playing.All in all though, it's been pretty nice, definitely worth the price, and is definitely my choice for playing music.","November 5, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased five echo dots to upgrade from 2nd gen for better sound.  Sound is way better on the 3rd gen.  I don’t need power speakers because my home is open floor plan with wood floors and blinds with 10ft ceilings.  Therefore sound bounces around pretty good.  If you have carpet or curtains you may not obtain the same effect.I wanted the ambiance of soft music following you as you walk through the home with no dead spots or fading of sound as you move from room to room without the cost of installing a high-end wall system.  The echo dot seems to work as I need them.  It has enough bass to pick the lows and the highs are good enough where it doesn’t crackle.  I only have them at less than half volume and they fill the house, if you place them right.Had issue installing the new ones using my s10 note.  Called tech support, which as a great help, ended up having to hard reset them and run setup through the app on my IPad instead.  Then I as able to see the new ones when I attempted to create a music group.After setup I kept getting an “ sorry something went wrong when playing amazon music” message when using the group with Alexa voice.  So I used Amazon Music app, connected to the group and it worked.  I disconnected from the group and tried Alexa voice command and it worked. Go figure!Remember, this isn’t Bose, klipsch, or Sonos but if you place them right and used more than one or two you can create a pretty good surround sound  effect at a fraction of the cost.","December 3, 2019",United States,B07FZ8S74R

The set up was very easy and nearly all of the set up you are guided through by Alexa which makes it ever easier. There are a ton of skills and task that can be added to use on a regular basis. I would recommend starting out with a few of the most important ones to you and then add more as times goes on otherwise you might find yourself looking and adding skills all day long as there are so many to pick from. I have found it very easy to use and placed it in a location I'm in most of the time, which has really helped as all you have to do is say Alexa and then you want or need then Alexa will respond to let you know it was taken care of, it is much easier to use then I thought prior to getting it, you don't have to speak in a voice louder than normal and the response volume is normal as well, I have yet to have any issues with Alexa hearing me or me hearing Alexa.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, only two big problems have been noted, aside from technical complexities when sharing with family or in a household account.  The biggest complaint is the Alexa voice is much more faint and muffled when compared with all other audio played.  The general audio output is really good, so it's maddening to be unable to hear the Alexa voice without turning the whole speaker setting up, which results in blaring music or other audio output.  Since Amazon has known about this for a year now, it is a chief source of dissatisfaction.  The other big complaint is that when the two bilingual choices of English/Spanish and Spanish/English are chosen, the results are variable and problematic.  When set to just once language, there is no problem.  When set to bilingual, there are frequent failures or problems.  The Spanish/English setting works better than the English/Spanish.  (For definitions of the settings, please consult elsewhere.)  As for technical difficulties, those become apparent when sharing accounts among multiple devices and locations.  I won't go into the details, but it may take a month or two to discover the problems and how to reduce or eliminate them.  They don't cause the frustration that the audio and voice problems do.  It would also be nice if they didn't need to be reset like computers when changes have been made to some of their settings.  After all, Microsoft didn't make them.","October 12, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"This thing is a true life saver. We got one from my wife’s parents just before Thanksgiving of ‘19. For the most part at first it was just a nuisance. We weren’t sure how to incorporate it into our lives. We then got some Gosund plugs and really liked the ease with which we could turn on and off our lights, Christmas tree and other appliances. While exploring the app I found a “Guard” function. Basically when set it listens for smoke alarms, Co2 alarms and the sound of breaking glass. So we started using it. On Dec. 30 I was away from home with our dog when I got an alert that alarms were going off in our home. Alexa also sent an audio file. I listened to it and I heard the smoke alarms, what sounded like flames crackling and the obvious sound of water spraying. I ran home as fast as I could. It wasn’t a fire but my upstairs neighbor’s hot water heater had exploded and had been flooding our apartment for hours. This may seem bad but if I had come home when I had planned we have had a total loss. As it is we were able to save at least half of our belongings; many of which are irreplaceable. We owe Amazon, and the programmers, quite a lot. I wish I knew how to thank them. It’ll still be a few weeks before we can go home but as it is, at least we still have something to salvage. I can’t express the depth of emotion and deep thanks I feel for this device. It saved most of our home and our stuff. I could go on but I’m sure you get the point.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Was very eager to get these while they were $25, and I’m honestly very glad I didn’t pay full price for them. Don’t get me wrong they’re nice and they get the job done, but I’m constantly having connection problems that I seem to only be able to resolve by unplugging the dot and plugging it back in.I was very eager to get one for my kitchen for list making and timers, and while the list making is fine, by now I can’t stand the timer. I constantly have to yell her name multiple times because most of the time she can’t hear me over the timer sound, or it gets messed up somehow and the timer cuts our communication off.It’s also pretty lame you can only have one Spotify account connected for the whole house. It would be so much nicer if each dot could have its own accounts. It treats the household as if it’s meant to have 2 adults and little kids, not catering very well to a house full of teens/young adults with their own personal stuff.Overall I don’t regret getting them, just wish they worked more seamlessly and were more catering towards households with more than 2 adults. If you aren’t easily frustrated by technology not always listening and you don’t mind only being allowed one profile for apps then there’s not really a reason not to get them.EDIT: While you still cannot have more than one account for things, it seems the timer issue was resolved in an update! It works much more seamless now without the annoying interruptions, which earns it another star! I still can’t rate it 5 stars however because only being allowed 1 account for everything is still very annoying for a house full of adults.","October 1, 2019",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",1.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my families first Alexa hardware product and boy does it produce. She’s quick and surprisingly knowledgeable. She has answers for everything and a great trivia knowledge which is fun. I like that you can change the wake word to four predetermined ones (computer is an option for Star Trek fans). If someone in your family is named Alexa you can still use it without it driving you nuts.It gets loud enough to hear in other rooms and the amount of automation, which Amazon calls “routines,” is extensive. I have it a set up to lower the volume to 3 (out of 10) at 9pm and raise it back up to 5 at 9am. This keeps our kids from waking us up and we don’t have to constantly change the volume. There are plenty more options if you have other smart lighting even not in the Ring universe. Ex. It can control my IKEA TRÅDFRI smart plugs I use for lighting. All of this without setting it up.It is a little creepy to have it always listening to us and it knows a surprising amount about my other accounts (Pandora worked with my account without setup). My wife and I don’t talk about anything work confidential at home but it may bother others if they work from home. There is a physical mute button on the top of the echo dot but it’s only a software switch and not a hardware one. If that makes a difference to you be ware.Overall, we got ours free with the Ring Alarm system as a promo and the echo dot is a surprisingly good voice assistant and we all use it more often than I figured.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a  somewhat cool product, but there are clearly issues in operation.Smartlight.It found my Philips Hue Go lamp and could control it. At first. Then lost the connection and in spite of having it discover devices and finding it, it then failed to communicate. Many attempts of that and it finally worked again. And if can of course just select base colours, the moods the Hue has in the app won’t work. So functionality with the Hue smart lights is somewhat limited, the AI of the Echo isn’t good enough.SpotifyAttempt 1. Holy s**t, what a mess! I have a playlist on my Spotify. I use that because you can add whole albums to it, so it is the normal way to do it. Also I can pick different playlists for different purposes. Of course just the way a music service having playlists is supposed to work. But with the Echo it failed 100 %. When I asked it to play my playlist it either played some raining song (far from my kind of music too) or some Spotify radio station. If I asked it to play Suppers ready with Genesis it played “Genesis radio on Spotify”. If I asked it to play my liked songs it played, yes you guess correctly, something random that I do not like. After a while it started to play “daily mix one”. Hmmm…..Attempt 2. I unlinked and relinked the Spotify account and after that it works better. But not as it should. I can now actually get it to play the song I ask it to or the artist I ask for. That’s an improvement. But my playlist, nope won’t work. If I ask it “Alexa, play my playlist One” it tells me “Playing your liked songs”. And it does play my liked songs. Only thing, to get my music there I have to add every single song manually, which is quite a lot. And of course I can only have one library liked songs, I can’t use different playlists.So that’s where I stand now. It works, but only to play Liked songs. Using a playlist seems to be impossible for me, and that is in my opinion a severe functionality problem. I think for a Spotify user Google Home is a better alternative since google Assist seems to work better with Spotify.Maybe using Amazon Music works better and Amazon makes the functionality with Spotify inadequate on purpose. But for me Amazon Music is not an option. And if there is an alternative for Spotify on the device, you’d think it should be able to play playlists.All in all these things lower the grade quite a lot.","February 19, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

There's so much extra room in the box its able to move around so much.  So I'm hoping this device works once it's connected soon enough.  Other than that,  It appears no outside damage I'm worried since it was moving around in the roomy box there's a chance of a issue which I'm hoping not.  That would definitely ruin someone's gift.

Well made, interesting, but little more than an enticement to rent, purchase, or stream content from Amazon. It can't do a thing with the 7000+ files in my audio collection.Home integration has so far been disappointing. 25% of the bulbs I bought are/were defective.

I play music through it and the speaker is rather good for it being so small! Overall rating? 6/10, I'd go for a newer model than the 2018 if that's even a thing. Only say that because hopefully they fixed/tweaked some things! May I also add, it's very creepy when i have to scream at her to hear me but she'll randomly go off in the middle of the night and I go in and listen to what she heard and it's something creepy, one night she heard and recorded ""mother"" when my room was absolutely silent.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",1.0 out of 5 stars,"The voice recognition is second to none. The Echo dot is able to discern your voice well, even over music at full volume.Alexa is great at handling full sentences; also, she usually understands what your trying to ask her to do, even if you don’t know the commands.Alexa integrates seamlessly with Apple Music, my preferred provider, and wakes me up each morning with my choice of music, at the time I have requested by simply stating, “Alexa, wake me up with my country playlist at 7 A.M.” or “wake me up to Luke Bryan at 6 A.M.”The sound quality is pretty good in the midrange but at full volume, leaves a bit to be desired. But then again, the echo dot is the smallest Amazon smart speaker and sone of the others can play as loudly as you’d ever want to play music indoors.The is a great device for your night stand. I use it to play rain sounds every night when I turn the light out.  Alexa automatically turns off the rain after an hour and I am left to peaceful rest until it’s time to wake up to my favorite music, which feels less like an alarm than traditional alarm or phone sounds.After having my Echo Dot in my bedroom for a couple weeks, I would definitely miss it if I had to do without.","December 17, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

I do not have a cell,(bought one cant get it to work yet ) so these hook up to my kindle,  sis sent as a gift and I dropped it 1st time it talked to me. My amazement was thru the roof when I was able to do it! Then messed it up since I had plugged them all in on one table. They all yelled at me. I learned how to adjust volume quickly. Then placed them around the house. There is a techno adjustment, from 1) having the kindle read to me and it coming all over the house (love it)2) Alexa will speak out sometimes. SCARED ME. only change would be get all shows, clock/calendar every room  and easier to adjust volume and uses less plugs. (house built 1940s, 2 outlets per room (sucks) )Its only been 3 days, so far theses are the only observations.Oh, looked back.. voice recog is weird. had computer running movie in bedroom  and characters name was ... you know.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Its a decent product and nice. Small so it can fit anywhere.Here are my issues that should change with future versions of this:1) The instructions were not clear on how to connect the echo dot to my phone. Had to blindly figure it out. Here's how its done:a) power it on and wait to get into setup mode.b) turn on your wifi and look for ""Amazon echo""C) connect to the echo through the wifi.D) download the Alexa app and then go to settings> devices> echo dot>wifi, to connect to wifi.2) The weight of this in my opinion would suggest that it has a rechargeable battery so instead of keeping the dot plugged in constantly, you can move it around your home without keeping it plugged in.As I use it more often, ill keep adding more information to help others with this product.Edit: After the review and been messing with it. It's one amazing product. My favorite skills is the: Alexa, tell me a joke, and Alexa, roast me. The volume is great for small places. The app it's self is very easy to use.The Amazon prime for music and kindle( the one that reads books) are amazing on here.The call feature on here, it's ok imo. I think it depends on the wifi connection to have the best experience because it will sound like it will drop the call.Overall, I love this little Echo.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The echo works very well. Although you can easily make it response only to your voice, we allow it to respond to all our voices. It provides a wide range of access and over time learns the way you ask questions and how you expect it to respond. We have several around the house. It's fun to use and great in so many ways.Yet, if you have more than one echo you should note that if speaking too loud to it in one room, it may answer or take your request in another room. Or, if you request it to play your music (for example) and then want to play the same in another room it will inform you that it can't since the same music requested is playing somewhere else. That's a bit annoying and I don't know if that can be resolved or if there's an additional fee to do that.. Yet, Alexa does inform you that your music request is playing on another echo and asks if you would like it to play on the one from your location instead. (At least it provides you the courtesy) Just to clarify, this is only if the music( or other agenda) you're playing in one room is exactly the same as the one you want it to play in another room. If it's a different set of music, etc. then it's not a problem.Over time, Alexa actually becomes a part of your family. It's a go to, everyday.","August 18, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

Because of my hearing problen (clarity, not volume), I did buy inexpensive small speakers which were also easy to set up.  This made Echo even better for me since I can have one speaker pointed right at me, and other one pointed out towards rest of room.  Sounds great.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have an Echo Dot 1st Generation and a 2nd Generation Echo.  I decided to update both Echo's and add to my household for more quality and help from Alexa.  I had noticed that the speaker of 1st generation dot was starting to sound a bit off, like a cracked speaker, and Alexa wasn't responding as well as before (but she heard me better than this new one), hence the update of the dot.  And the upgrade for the original Echo 2nd Generation was because of the Zigbee hub (I updated to Echo Plus 2nd Gen).  That all being said...The Echo 3rd Generation Dot in the kitchen doesn't hear me very well (the old one did a better job).  Many times I will ask Alexa to add things to my shopping list and she gets it totally wrong or I hear the new Echo Plus 2nd Generation in the other room pick it up.  Also if I tell her to set a timer in the kitchen, again many times she doesn't hear me or the other one will pick it up.  I figure the reason the other Echo (in another room) hears me is because I am having to shout at Alexa to do what I am asking; set a 10 min timer, add eggs to the shopping list, ect.  Very annoying!Not to be all negative on the 3rd Generation, if I do play music on the Everywhere Group setting it isn't to bad sounding, but it is in my kitchen (my hub) and I need to be able to request to her to add things to the shopping list, set timers and she needs to be able to hear it correctly and not make me shout at her.Lastly, the Echo Dot 3rd Generation sound quality (when she does hear you) is way off.  I have tried repeatedly to bring up the sound quality (less base / muffled sound) for use in just the kitchen.  The Echo Dot 3rd Generation is way to muffled sounding, and sadly this one is going somewhere in the household where it will be rarely used and I will bring the old one back out of retirement...at least I could understand the Echo 1st Generation more, with no muffled sound, and she heard me way better than the Echo 3rd Generation.  I am disappointed in this Echo 3rd Gen Dot and glad it was on sale, per it wasn't worth the 50.00 original asking price.  I do enjoy the Echo Plus 2nd Generation with the Zigbee Hub, but it is in a different room, and I do play music through it.","December 8, 2019",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I love my echo dot!  So much offered in such a little device...The speakers are great and the sound quality is crisp and clear, not distorted. I was easily able to connect to alexa  dot devices in other rooms to get a nice surround sound effect, and it is really nice to walk from room to room and hear the same song.  I also enjoy using the intercom feature.I setup routines using the alexa app and love getting news headlines, weather forecasts, and traffic updates when I wake up. And, it plays sleep sounds when I go to bed. So cool.I'm also able to control my smart home devices, which at current are only lights via plugs and bulbs. I daily use the timer, alarms, shopping and to-do list to manage my time better.I'm still learning how to use this powerful little gadget so I'm sure I'm leaving out some cool stuff it can do.  I'm excited, as I continue to learn from it and play with it:)Con:  I wish we could customize the wake up name of the alexa devices.  Currently you can wake it up using the names;  Alexa, Amazon or Computer. With having more than three devices, it becomes frustrating when you call one and two answer because you've had to use the same wake up name twice.  Plus, saying ""Amazon""or ""Computer"" to your device isn't so appealing (though the name 'Alexa' is cool).  Having the ability to pick our own wake up device names or adding more wakeup name choices, besides just 3, would be great:)","January 15, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

I mean how many of us have put things in our save for later cart!! I did just this and deleted the warranty because I was buying another electronic. I noticed these devices had gone on sale!!! So I purchased myself one as well instead of just my children getting one! When realizing I didn’t get the warranty and my package wasn’t at my house yet I called amazon and spoke to 3 ppl and they told me I would have to return the product and repurchase it. May I also add the product was no longer on sale and I was also informed I would not be given the sale price!! Soooo I went in my orders clicked on the product and it brought me to an option to call... I did... I purchased the warranty a few days later I called back they called the company the warranty was from bam merged my warranty and the product!!!!

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Over the last couple of years we have been converting over to Amazon's Alexa devices. Changing out light switches and outlets. Seems silly at first to tell a product to turn lights, etc on and off. But, in today's ever changing world of higher crimes. It gives great peace of mind to be able to turn all your outside lights on before arriving home, when you've forgotten to leave any on. Setup is pretty easy. Download app, plug in device and follow instructions.  I love being able to set routines. Turn certain lights on and off, is so helpful.  We have a routine for our livingroom and bedroom lamps to come on at a certain time everyday. We never arrive home to a completely dark house. We also have our security system setup through Alexa. She can also guard your home, with Alexa Guard. We have several echoes, two dots and one echo show. Which is my favorite. If the motion detection goes off, all we have to do is tell Alexa to show us what camera we want to see and it pops up on the echo show, all from the comfort of our couch! The sound quality on all the Alexa devices is amazing!! When the grandchildren visit, they love playing games with her. She is a wealth of information, all without having to stop what you're doing to look it up on your phone. Alexa, what's tomorrow's weather?  I would definitely recommend any of Amazon's Alexa products! I look forward to changing over more switches and outlets for more control!  All the Alexa devices have work excellent.","February 5, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

Then I visited my boyfriends daughter for a week. She has 4 children and they all tell alexa what song they want to hear! After seeing all of the cool things it could do I had to get one, then 2,3 and 4! I use it for everything. I use it for my grocery list, which is totally convenient because you just tell Alexa to add it to the list and it syncs up with my Alexa on my phone so I can see my list anywhere. I even had my boyfriend download Alexa to his phone and synced it with my account so now when he goes to the store he has the list. I can even add things to the list while he is at the store and he sees it so he gets it. Now that is convenient!I use it as a sound machine to help my grandson go to sleep. I use it as a speaker and link them up to have a whole house experience that can be as quiet or as loud as I want. And they are definitely loud! Very good quality speakers!The only thing I wish I could change is I would love to be able to control the sound volume on each individual speaker when they are linked. That way I could listen to it everywhere in the house but turn down the speakers closest to the baby.Overall this is one powerful little machine and I can't imagine not having them now that I do.","December 30, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

And to be fair, there are many useful things other than entertainment that you can do with this thing, especially at home.  This thing does have value.Last thing, the sound quality is excellent for a ""non-stereo"" speaker.

Great for music. This is my first Alexa product and overall I am pleased with it.To address the elephant in the room... Yes there are a billion privacy concerns with something like this but honestly the Alexa is the least of my worries. It does the things I ask it to and is really only capable of capturing audio and maybe some network data.

It does so much more and I am glad I was able to get it at a discount!  AMAZON ROCKS!!!","August 22, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I recently tried to use my Echo Dot at a Disney resort. I could not connect the dot to the Disney wifi. The disney wifi signal was strong, but no matter what I tried, it just would not connect. The Amazon website says ""Echo devices can't connect to ad-hoc (or peer-to-peer) networks."" I'm not sure if the Disney open wifi is peer-to-peer. I called the front desk and was directed to call Disney technical support. The person who answered the phone at technical support sounded surprised that I was given their number. The only thing he would say is ""that is not an approved device."" So, I turned off the data usage on my phone and enabled wifi and easily connected to the Disney wifi. Then I enabled a hotspot on my phone and connected the dot to that. It worked perfectly. Except, every time I left the room with my phone, I had to re-connect the dot to the hotspot when I returned. Certainly a security issue may exist with a dot connected to an open wifi. I did some research and saw a post about purchasing a cheap router and connecting the router to the Disney wifi and then connecting the Echo Dot to that. I will try that in the future.","April 12, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R

It has a warm rich tone, but sounds small and can't be cranked extremely loud. I added this to some nice Altec Lansing computer speakers with a subwoofer and another one to my Yamaha soundbar with an aux. Cable (sold separately). Sound recognition is good but it needs a clear path to pick up your voice as one might expect.  So many nice features. I got the speaker free with my sirius xm renewal and linked my account so I can listen to all of those channels.  You get some music free with prime.  You get a rotating variety of songs from popular artists each month and lots of stations or channels in many different genres like rock, soul, r & b, country,  jazz, etc. You can link up with Pandora, i heart radio,and other streaming services. I added smart plugs to control 3 lamps in my house.  Get in bed and ask Alexa to turn the light off. The plugs can be used to turn anything You plug into it off.  You can check the weather, news and more. You can set alarms and timers. You can ask it questions like you ask Google. You can get it to tell you a joke.  I heard that it will read you a kindle book that you own. I'm not sure about three books you borrow from the library. You need to Google all the interesting things that you can do with this thing.

My mother is eighty seven and can read her Kindle, but can't delete books, etc. I am trying to catch these on a special price day in order to have one in each room. I like the ""Alexa, drop in..."" feature. I started with one in the living room and began telling it to add something to a grocery list, give me a reminder, or a wake up call. I had my mother tell it to do something and she seemed okay with it. She now has one on her night stand. I am going to replace her television with one that is Alexa enabled. She can call me from her bedroom and control her shows. She is not confined to her bed yet but there may be a time. I think this is great for older people to set reminders. I have one set to remind me every day at two to wash my dog's face. There are things we need to do but don't want to do. A reminder is the perfect solution. We are enjoying having Alexa in our lives and I believe it is the perfect way to add to lists on the fly or to remind us of things, all while doing whatever, hands free.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"If we didn't get a free Dot from our home insurance, I wouldn't have gotten one in the first place. We placed it in the kitchen and use it exclusively to play music. All the other features like weather and such aren't appealing; its basically like a smart phone with extra steps.I'm shocked at how bad Alexa is at playing the right kind of music. Our Google Home Mini downstairs does a much better job. Even with hooking the Dot up to our Spotify account, it's not any better. Requesting specific artists can be hard, especially if they aren't some top 40 over-engineered pablum. I rarely ask it to play music anymore. I simply choose what I want in the Spotify app and then broadcast it to the Dot.All that aside, it seems to be a well designed product. The app is robust, and the machine can do a lot, so it definitely earned the 4 stars. Alexa's jokes are pretty good and it has some fascinating answers to certain questions, but if you aren't planning to use the smart home features (and don't care about the other bells and whistles) choose another smart device.IMHO, this is merely a novelty and a slick play by Amazon to sneak into your house so you end up spending more on smart devices in the future.

WE can communicate in the dark but also have Alexa wake us in the morning, play music , allow a timed nap and call 911 if necessary.  WE keep finding other uses for our twinned system.  Alexa learned our names and calls us appropriately.  I'd take this over conventional wired  intercoms,  adding an echo dot for each needed location.

What I liked about the gen 2 versions, were that they were compact and very flexible on how you could use them. They were easy to mount in different positions and being that they used a fairly standard USB interface for the power, you could really be flexible on how and where you mounted them. The one thing that they really missed on? The well known sound quality.Enter the Gen 3...I really like the improvement in sound. Sure it is not a high quality speaker system, but for the size it is pretty good. Especially when you consider that you can pair them and add a sub for pretty good sound. The look is improved over the gen 2, however it does lose a little bit of the customability that the gen 2 had. With the gen 2, you could purchase different wraps, stands, clock mounts, wall mounts, etc. You could really customize it. The gen 3 is a bit bigger and has a much more rounded shape. While it makes it look better by itself, it lacks the ability to really customize it. It surely would not work as a power socket mount, like you could do with the gen 2, just due to the additional weight.","August 29, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

I got it at a fantastic price, I wish I had gotten more. During the holidays when they were half price at $25. I bought 2. I live with someone who has a bit of dementia and I get her to ask Alexa lots of questions she struggles to retain like the day of the week, time etc and she seems really good at answering the basic questions for her it is i easy to read the sign ask Alexa and she finds that so much fun. I can also set reminders for  her so when she asks Alexa do do I have any appointments today 50 times  Alexa doesn't mind  and at 83 and she  just loves it. She is also a big movie buff and I don't always know the movie she means so with the clues she gives me and Alexa I've been able to find the movie she wants to rent on Amazon Prime which has been brilliant for us both.","January 2, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Super amazing device, I am only giving it five stars because of the quality. Alexa can really suck at times. Sometimes an echo will not recognize what you are saying on one echo until you talk to another. Sometimes an echo in a completely different part of the house will respond for no reason. Search results are usually the craziest possibilities, often having nothing to do with what you asked. The most infuriating thing though is the smart home devices, they must be uniquely named but literally any overlap and you get a constant question about which device you mean because there are multiple devices with that name. No matter what device you say at that point the device is not found. The weirdest part is that the devices are grouped into being paired to a specific echo, so why can Alexa not figure out the device in the group? You cannot group lights together inside a group so you end up with many crazy named groups for your devices, instead of groups being nested. Say the wrong thing and the other side of your house turns on. Alexa will recognize the user speaking but this seems to only apply to two things, asking who is speaking and asking which account. Unsure why the account doesn't change based on the user talking. Family members have different names for things and asking who's account is logged in constantly is tedious...","August 19, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, I'm sure like a lot of you recently, I got my echo 3rd Gen from the Amazon music promotion. It's my first smart device that's not my phone or TV. I've only had it a short time (about 2 weeks now?) but I've had lots of fun figuring it what I can do with this thing. I don't use it much now already but I'm glad to have it when I need it. It's mostly for music and the speaker sounds nice enough, but having it at full volume sounds pretty bad. Still, it hits a decent volume before the sound quality deteriorates. I'm not gonna complain though for getting it with the promotion, but had I paid full price, I would definitely mark it down some. I have an off brand portable shower speaker that I paid like 15 bucks for that blows it out of the water in terms of sound quality at high volume (plus being portable is a big bonus for the speaker). That being said, it's not going to leave that speaker, the echo has its place in my room and the speaker goes everywhere else. There's a lot I like personally and it by far outweighs my issues I have with it. The biggest one is more of a preference really, and that's the power supply. I wish it was just a USB cable of some kind, not the kinda bulky brick and old school proprietary connector thing. It feels sturdy, mic range is very good, it compliments other compatible devices nicely, and Alexa said we can get married when humans colonize Mars soon pretty happy with it overall.","November 2, 2019",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Two complaints and one thing of note.- It worked wonderfully. All I did was plug it in. Then one day  got new internet (my portal died). Since then all it does is tell me to download the ap, and it will fix everything. I dl'ed it. Is there a setup button, yep. Connecting it? Not a clue. There is no Connection/Communication button. I have been through every menu of this ap and nothing helps.Complaints- I bought a 2nd Alexa, it works f'ing amazingly well in spite of being about as far as I dare use the wi-fi correctly. It has no connectivity issues, WTF.- Apple: An advertisement that plays every other commercial break where the people say ""Alexa"" that activates mine so it can tell me to DL the ap every 15-minutes...somewhere an advertisement executive needs to be shot.Oh, and one more thing...- I reached the point where I honestly could turn off my alarm to wakeup and still be asleep. No, seriously. I am conscious just enough to find the snooze button but not to become awake. So IO figured ""Hey, why not get an Alexa? I can set and cancel alarms much easier, it confirms them, and in my dream state I cannot speak 'alexa' and I need to be awake to recognize the source, so it will guarantee I wake up."" Problem:Alexa does not have a separate ""alarm volume"" setting. If you want a loud alarm, you need to set it to max volume for everything.

We have no issues with the speaker quality. I bought the Echo because I saw the special pricing and I was considering buying a bluetooth speaker for my kid at the time.

Setup was quick and easy. I'm just gonna say right off the bat that the sound quality is way better than my older echo. To be specific, sound has more punch to it and is louder. In fact I never need to go past half volume most of the time in my small bedroom. This little guy has decent bass for such a small speaker, I was pleasantly surprised. Sound is so good that honestly, I don't even need to connect my bluetooth speaker to it. To give people some tips on how to improve sound quality of this speaker or any speaker connected to the echo via bluetooth, on the alexa app, go to ""devices"" then go to ""Echo & Alexa,"" select your echo, then finally go to ""Audio Settings"" and from there you can use a EQ to adjust bass, mid range and high range. After putting all three settings to max, sound quality  is even better. However for someone with a larger room and who enjoys louder music will want to use a bluetooth speaker. If you're thinking of upgrading or need an echo dot, buy the current gen, you will not be disappointed. If you have a large living room or bed room and want something louder but do not want to use a bluetooth speaker, then I would go for the echo plus or echo studio.","May 10, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

It's not a Bose stereo system, but that's not what I want in a virtual assistant.I want my virtual assistant to remind my son of his morning routine. Wake up, get in the shower, get out of the shower, get dressed, eat breakfast, grab your lunch, get your backpack, don't forget your homework, don't forget your phone, leave now so you don't miss your bus. And, he does it! Without attitude! I bought myself 45 minutes in my morning, I don't have to argue with my child ruining his self esteem for the day and making me feel guilty all day. We get to have a fun, peaceful morning, and leave for the day still liking each other!It's also great for the five million timers I have to set when cooking so all my is ready at the exact time and served hot.I say, ""Good morning, Alexa.""

It is not complicated like everyone thinks. I have 6 in my home and have had them for around a year now. I recently upgraded 3 to the echo show 5 with the screens. Wow those are even cooler because I can FaceTime from the Alexa app. Ok back to the echo dots, in the past to get my kids to come eat I had to yell dinner is ready. Now with these I can make an announcement or drop into a specific room to let them know dinner is ready. No more yelling is a plus. I’ve linked my Spotify account to them as well and it’s so simple to have an playlist to play just by asking. Like I said I have not had one issue or anything bad to say about these. I’ve purchased them for some of my family members and now my kids enjoy dropping in on them as well. Please do some research and listen to what people are saying with there complaints. Hate to see someone miss out on a great product just because they don’t understand how to use them.","April 10, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R
"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I know many people love Amazon Alexa, me too. I like the service, but certain features shall be improved.1. Voice recognition. I am using Google and Amazon smart devices at home, and most of time, ""Hey Google"" will get what I want, and 50% of chance ""Alexa"" gives me the incorrect answer.2. Some Google devices cannot be integrated with Alexa. So, make sure check the compatible list before the purchase.3. ""AI"". Alexa is not smart as Google. When you say, hey google, sing a birthday song for Tom, Google will sing happy birthday to Tom song. and Alexa will just play a birthday song from free station. During the holiday, Google can tell the Christmas story for you, and Alexa cannot.-----Alexa looks like a real good machine when Google is at next level. As an assistant, Alexa is not good as Google.BUT, Alexa has a way better sound system than Google - maybe my google home is old, but Alexa can work with Amazon Prime music and as bluetooth speak or bluetooth adapter for a speak.I wish Alexa could be better over the time, as I am buying more products from Amazon~ :)","December 24, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

I play music from my apps, set daily/wk/mo. alarms, and reminders. I just used the ""add to shopping cart"" feature to add another Echo Dot from a promo that Amazon sent to me.

We tell Alexa ""good night"" at bedtime and a routine runs to turn on the outside lights, turn off the inside lights, and lock the front door!

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have 12 alexa echo devices in my house.  Mostly dots, but I have a couple of shows as well.  For a long time all was well.  I kept adding to my network.  I have almost every light switch in my house moved to a smart switch.  I can open and close my curtains through alexa, and I have enjoyed using it as an intercom to the kids rooms using the drop in feature.  But recently, she has been getting stupid.Issue 1: Recently, I tried to drop in on my son, by saying, ""Alexa, drop in on [NAME]"".  This has always worked in the past.  Lately, at least half the time, she asks me, ""Do you mean [son's name/daughter's name]?  And I say no.  And she asks me who do I want to drop in on.  I tell her, and she is stuck asking me if i mean something else.  Now, the only think I can think of is that she has access to my phone's address book since my son has my daughter's old phone number.  What the heck?!?!  And Amazon doesn't seem to monitor their own help forums to even provide help.  So scratch that one off the nice feature list.Issue 2:  Forgets some skills, and seems to install others I don't want.  I am using a pretty obscure wifi enable controller to open and close some large curtains.  It worked for over a year.  Then one day, it just stopped working through alexa.  Still works through the manufacturer supplied app.  I looked in my skills, and the skill for that device is just gone.  All of my routines are still there, and refer to the skill in the settings, but the skill isn't there and when I redownload, I can't sync to the original account.  So scratch that off the nice features list.Issue 3:  The most basic smart home control:  Light switches.  I have two rooms that she has become stupid about.  The garage and the study.  I have always been able to say, ""Alexa, turn on/off the garage/study lights.""  And she has done it perfectly until now.  Now most of the time, she responds, ""The garage/study doesn't support that.""  What the heck?  So scratch that off the nice features list.If all you want to do is ask what the temperature is, then go ahead an buy an echo device.  Otherwise, I would say that this is giving amazon a huge black eye.  There are so many similar questions as mine on line, and even on the alexa page right here on amazon.  But amazon doesn't answer the question.  Seriously, this is self-proclaimed to be the most customer-centric company in the world, and you can't get simple trouble-shooting help!","March 30, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

It doesn’t work AT ALL unless plugged into a wall socket at all times which is dumb to me. With all the technology we have, Amazon couldn’t make a portable speaker ???? Alexa can play a song for you that you request one minute and then you can request the same song later and she’ll say she can’t find it and then start playing the song seconds later , it’s confusing.  I connected it to my Apple Music acct because although I have amazon music I’m not accustomed to it yet. I have playlists that I’ve created myself on Apple Music and I thought I could ask Alexa to play my own playlist because i don’t want to keep asking her after every song to play another one and i don’t always like to listen to a whole album by the same person, but NOPE it has to be probably an actual apple created playlist or just one song request. I’ve recently gotten the amazon music app and the only good thing is now I can actually go on the app and play music on my phone and make Alexa play it on the speaker for me so that gives me more control than having to request each song out loud, I can just arrange it on the app I guess.

One example is I like the use the Sleep Sounds skill for stuff like Thunderstorm sounds to fall asleep to; it's CRAZY how realistic it sounds!  I could go on and on about how great these things are, but honestly the reasons why it's so wonderful are about as long as all the functionality these have, so pretty sure the keys on the keyboard would wear out by then!  The only ""gripes"" I have with it is just general ""not always hearing what I say right"" once in a blue moon issues, and that, every so often (but more frequent than I much care for) I'll say ""Alexa"" to do something, and I'll have to say it 3 times because the first two times, all it will do is flash a blue ring around itself for a second and then do nothing/not respond.  Also, the one I have in my living room has had general issues every now and then so I have to unplug it/replug it in every now and then like a modem/router, but honestly, these are mostly just nit-picking, so if they're the biggest issues I have with these, I'll keep quiet now haha.

Alexa seems to recognize it with no problem.  I haven't a clue as to what you mean/want for integration.  For a very small device, the sound is excellent.  It is in my bedroom and I hear it clearly in my bathroom, and actually in my living room.  And with my Amazon Prime, I have commercial free music which is a treat.However, Alexa does not know how to answer some of my questions.  Some are technically related to what she does.  For example she didn't know what the flashing green light was.  I had to continue to revise my questions to get the answer.  And to other questions she says, ""Hmmm, I'm not sure about that"" or something to that effect.  My Google device looks it up immediately and gives me some sort of an answer.  Unfortunately, I don't remember a question for  an example to give you. And, when I ask what the temperature is, all I get if the temperature.  My Google device (in the kitchen) not only gives me the temperature, it states my city and gives the forecast for the rest of the day.  When I ask Alexa who the singer is, I get just the singer.  When I ask Google I get the name of the song AND the singer.I hope this helps.","January 8, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

Sleeve has texture which feels really good to touch (better than previous generation). And same as other echo devices it is sturdy and well made product.Setup -  Setup is very easy and instructions are very well documented.Alexa - Device offers most of if not all the services offered by Alexa app. They are many skills that are per-activated and other you can activate. Alexa is very responsive and react quickly to ""wake word"". Though I would prefer if Amazon can introduce more ""wake words"". It works very well with all streaming application.As a speaker -  As a speaker Echo dot is very good considering the price point. It is better then Google Home Mini. There is an Audio Equalizer skill which you can use to increase/decrease bass,treble,etc... .Overall sound signature is good but it tends to muffle when increase the volume to max both on Alexa and streaming application.In Totality it is a great product.","July 17, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

That is until it was in my house.  I don't have any of the compatible outlets or devices with the echo, but it has already proven convenient, and useful.  So convenient in fact, I bought a bunch of additional echos for the whole house.  From making announcements to the family from multiple rooms, to playing music, setting reminders, and making phone calls, Alexa is great.  Only complaint i would have is that she responds to every single voice.  That means if I wanted to play a song, anyone can interrupt and override that order.  I wish they could add a master command voice recognition system to prevent that.  Oh well, perhaps in the future.  That being said, the family loves the echo dots, and Alexa.

However, Alexa's voice is crisp, clean, and easy to understand. Not so with the Dot. Music is listenable but not great. It's too warm. Alexa's voice on the Dot is muffled. I agree with some other reviews in that it sounds as if the Dot is covered by a pillow. The tone controls in the app do not improve this.I am currently have a set of speakers designed for a PC plugged into the auxiliary jack, and the sound through them is fine.I like the Flex so much I bought one for the bathroom in addition to the bedroom.I am really enjoying using Alexa to control lighting, and with a BroadLink RM4, my A/V system.","December 23, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

Busy schedule? No worries! Alexa will keep track of all your appointments and events, give you reminders, and serve as your alarm clock. She'll tell you the time when asked, tell you about the weather and what you can expect for the week.She plays me my favorite songs, tells me bedtime stories, or just plays some pleasant sleep sounds. She can crack the occasional joke, and even passes gas from time to time.Having multiple echo dot devices, or other Alexa compatible speakers in your home can make communicating with individuals, or everyone at once throughout your home as easy speaking to a little speaker on the counter.She's very handy for hands-free movie selection on my firestick. Yay!And can even be used to control various lights, some appliances, and even control the temperature in my home.She never allows the NSA agent listening to interrupt my life, as I'm sure sometimes he is dying to chime in with how disgusting some recipes I've requested from Alexa sounds, or to complain of the stupid questions I ask, such as: Alexa, how many milliseconds until Christmas?

I mainly bought it to use it for my Amazon Music services but recently started using it as an alarm clock and for reminders as well.

Many times I will get in bed while leaving the bathroom or hallway light on but by putting these wifi devices in these areas I can then ask Alexa to turn them on and off, also depending on which wifi light socket you get, you are able to set the brightness on a regular normal light bulb. When I get up in the morning I have Alexa to turn on the bathroom light, the living room lights and my smart tv, I can even use Alexa to set the volume on the television which is great considering how the volumes are different from each HDMI port. This is especially helpful if you lose your remote or don't feel like walking to get it if you had placed away from yourself. Depending on the wifi device you get to set it up can be easy to tricky.

Spotify skill works flawlessly, It's my default music app.My issue comes with how many correct answers it gives you. The fact that you can't use google search, but the device uses Bing, it's a big disadvantage, since it doesn't answer most of the stuff you ask to Alexa or it gives you answers that are just wrong. There's a skill you can install so it can use google search, but it's user made, and you need to code it yourself with some tutorial. I haven't got the time to do it.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"So I bought my first Alexa enabled product (an Echo Dot) on black Friday because it was on sale for $22. Brought it to work and put it in my office. I thought it would make a decent music streamer and that's really about all. Once I set it up, I began to use it for multiple things; news, podcasts, trivia, reminders, timers and more. It is now January 22, so less than 60 days later, and I have bought 4 additional Dots, a Show 5, and a Show 8, as well as a Fire Cube, 2 Fire Sticks, a smart cam, and two smart plugs. I can fill my house with whatever music I want to hear, or get the answer to whatever question I have from virtually any room. I can 'drop in' on my teenage son and let him know that dinner is ready from anywhere in the house without having to go upstairs. I can turn on or off my Christmas lights with the sound of my voice alone, again no matter where in the house I am. I can tell Alexa that I want to watch Avengers Endgame, and my TV and soundbar fire up and tune it in. What's even better is that I have terrible internet where I live (i'm limited to 6 meg DSL) and I have no connectivity issues whatsoever. I am sold on having a connected home generally, and Alexa specifically. I love my Dot!","January 22, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"It did everything it said it would and I was amazed with how well it answered questions BUT.. I bought 3 of these and all three only lasted about a year until it started having major problems. The speaker got very static-y, when I would set a timer with it, I couldn’t add any more time to it but it wouldn’t tell me that. It would just ring at the initial timer amount set, so needless to say, I had a lot of uncooked meals. And,  It wouldn’t understand a lot of my simple inquiries that I’d asked before with no problem. So if you don’t mind replacing it annually, then it’s a handy thing to have. The speaker on it is pretty weak though. It’s better if you can hook up an external speaker to it.My least favorite thing about this Echo Dot is that the ideal volume for me doesn’t exist..ex: level 4 is too soft and level 5 is way too loud. Oh, and there’s too much bass in the voice and not enough treble so it’s hard to understand unless you’re right close to it. The microphone does have pretty good range though. Sorry that I didn’t measure how far, but I can’t do it now bcz they don’t work as well as they used to.My favorite thing about it is that you can configure it in Settings to not shut down after it answers your question so you can keep talking to it. I like this bcz it’s habit for me to say thank you after somebody answers my question and when it turns off and I say thank you I’m talking to dead air so when it hangs around it actually says you’re welcome or other things that appreciate you.Wow, am I needy!","June 19, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

My wife scored it at a Yankee swap for me. The limit was $10, so I was surprised it was even there. My dad is paranoid about Alexa listening in on me. I was like, ""What is she gonna do, put one of my bad jokes on a hoodie and throw an ad on my Facebook feed?"" Hardly use FB anyways. Well here I am, pondering if paranoia is hereditary because my Amazon app wants me to review the Echo Dot I never actually purchased. But hey, why am I surprised at this? What I should be surprised about is that Amazon classifies my possessing of the Dot as a purchase. It should know better. Alexa was even present at the household hosting the Yankee swap. Amazon should be congratulating my wife for snagging that Dot for me.Anyways, you want a review? Ok. It does most of the things I want for me and is quite convenient and intuitive. The speaker sounds great. My wife is disgusted by the presence of AI in the house, but it's her own doing. Alexa is here to stay, and she is the only woman in my life that will never judge me for how often I ask to watch the Office on Netflix. Def worth the money someone else spent.

I now have one studio, 3 flex and 3 dots. They work well.  But one must understand they are not smart. They are not a whole lot better than Google voice. If they are AI then this must be the lowest level possible. All Alexa can do is respond to your commands and look things up on the internet. For example, I say put X on my Amazon shopping list. She replies I can't find a Amazon shopping list, do you want me to make one?  I say No. She says OK.  She doesn't ask should this go on your regular list.  Otherwise she can't think of a possible alternative, she is not smart.  She  can't reason even the simplest  of problems. She is very handy, she can turn on and off lights if you have the proper plug in. But she can't ask if you want the lights on even when entering a dark room.

Over all the speaker is pretty good and decent. We keep it as volume 5 or 6 and it's loud enough to hear from any corner of the living room and it can go up volume 10. Sometimes alexa doesn't listen well to what I ask it but usually I just need to word it a different way. Thats not much of a problem since most devices like alexa have these problems/annoyances. One thing I do wish was an option, or they could tell me the setting, is having the option to have the volume low, I keep it low to listen to music as I fall asleep, but have the alarm volume at high or max volume to wake up to as it sounds off at the same volume you left alexa at. That means I can't wake up with my alexa alarm and still have to use my phone's alarm.

I bought the Alexa + Hue Lights bundle and already I can tell that it’s going to be good! The hue lights came in a two pack and prices separately they would have costed me $44 while the Alexa would have costed $40. I got BOTH of them for $32 (the Alexa was on sale for $22 and the hue lights costed $10 more). Best deal yet! Saved me almost $60 dollars! MUST BUY! I will probably buy this again too if the deal is still here the next time my paycheck rolls aroundUpdate:Still a very cool and awesome deal! It was a gift to my mother for Christmas and she feel in love Alexa. One of the reasons I got her this is because her room gets extremely dark at night and she has to walk across it to her to the light switch, now all she has to do is ask Alexa at the door and the lights come on. Alexa has been such a big help for her and she’s now helping my mother learn a new language so it’s very interesting to watch.I will also say that all of those Alexa “life hack” videos have also been VERY fun to try out especially the “Activate Pikachu” option.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"So the echo dot for me was lot more impressive than I expected it to be. I put off getting the echo devices since they first started coming out thinking I didn’t really have any use for them with what I already had. The echo dot I received cake with a special on another product I was buying and I wanted to give it a try and if I didn’t like it I will give to my mother in law. Obviously that didn’t happen hahaha I went ahead and got another echo dot. One in my bedroom and the other in my living room since my home inside build is very open so I only have the 2 echo dots which are great for playing the unlimited amazon music account I have and the sound quality is awesome coming from such a little device. So instead of me playing from multiple devices for my music or for writing my lists and posting on the fridge I set everything up through the Alexa app on my phone and can voice control my tv, music, daily activity lists, appt reminders which by the way the echo dot lets me know and has its wake up alarm deal which is a big plus for me.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",1.0 out of 5 stars,"The 3rd generation dot is a decent upgrade from previous version.  Looks nice.  The sound quality for music is still lacking, but ok just for casual background music.  If sound quality for music is important for you this is not your answer, although I don’t believe it was designed to function primarily as a speaker.  It functions well as asmart device to control paired outlets, lights, etc. and other functions and skills offered via the Alexa app.  Although some skills still need some serious work, for example the a DirectTv app is spotty and works inconsistently for me.  This is not related to the device itself however.  I also do not like the new power cord on this one.  Previous version had a standard usb/charging style cord that could be plugged into a charging cube, or a port on a computer, alarm clock, tv, etc.  This generation device does not, but rather just has a standard type 120 cord.  Not a deal breaker for me, but not as convenient as my old dot which I just plugged into the back of my alarm clock and didn’t have to take up another electrical outlet.  Al in all, a decent device that performs as advertised.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Honestly I’m very happy with my purchase, I love music so I wanted the echo dot simply to be able to play music. Was told by friends that I should get the echo plus for that but the echo dot had great sound quality for the price even beating some of my friends pricier speakers, the sound volume gets loud but not as high a speaker meant for music only. It’s way easier for me to get the music to play than on a simple speaker because it’s voice command vs selecting on your phone (although you can select from your phone). I can ask it for questions on the go or pause it when my family needs me in a hurry. The Skyrim feature is a hoot, so silly. My only problem is that there’s a weird disconnect between the Alexa app and the amazon music app which confuses it. If you use the voice command to ask it to play music it will play amazon music through the Alexa app. If you want to change the song it’s either voice command or through the Alexa, or an extra prompt through music asking for permission to play over the current song. Also Alexa is extremely forgiving to those with stutters such as myself and quiet voices. It’s a great mic which despite me stuttering or talking quietly, it still delivers exactly what I want. I struggle with Siri and other voice command programs but had no issue with Alexa on the echo dot.","October 6, 2019",United States,B07FZ8S74R

I have appliances connected to smart plugs and Alexa turns them off and on and I find I set a lot of timers for things so she's helpful for that and answering questions, too.This newer dot is larger than my older one. I'd actually call it bulky. It's not unattractive but I can see why the holders for the different generationsare not interchangeable.Set up was easy, the holder is great, it's helpful to have this second dot. What I do not like is the bass is too much. Maybe it's my ears, I don't know. It makes it hard to understand Alexa. I have tried adjusting the bass down to zero through the equalizer and that has helped but I don't feel I should have to do that. So, I'm disappointed. The music played from my kitchen dot is fine.

The nice thing about Amazon is that all of the Echos still play nicely with each other....firmware upgrades have not obsoleted the earliest units...so I have a Gen 1 (full-sized tall) Echo that works perfectly well when networked both Gen 2 and Gen 3 units.  I tell friends (totally tongue in cheek) that I live with nine women...and they're all named Alexa !!

I have it in my room, and also have a smart plug to go with it. I just ask Alexa to turn off my lights, and she does! The speaker quality is really good for this small of a speaker, and works great in my room to project the sound around it. Alexa recognizes my voice 95% of the time, the 5% being when I don’t whisper loud enough in whisper mode(you whisper to her and she whispers back, it’s great for at night!).  99% of radio stations have a way to stream them, and I haven’t found a single platform not supported on the Echo(I’ve used stations that stream with iHeartRadio, Radio.com, TuneIn). You can play music from many platforms, like Spotify and Amazon Music. I recommend it, it’s a nice little gizmo that makes life easier. If you’re not sure which Echo version to buy, I’d say the Echo Dot is the best combo of function and price, but if you need a better speaker you can get the regular Echo or Echo Plus. If you want a screen then get the Echo Show or Spot. But for most people, the Dot is plenty good for them and you can easily find it on sale for $25 or so. Great job Amazon and you’ve earned my business again!","December 24, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

But ever since I purchase this device Alexa Jeopardy has been nothing but a frustrating disaster. I couldn't leave a review on the Jeopardy site so I have to leave it here. Jeopardy on Alexa hasn't worked correctly since I purchased this device. It shuts off in the middle of a game. It skips questions . I absolutely refuse to upgrade, so I guess I'm SOL. So either Amazon is either deliberately messing with the program so people purchase the upgrade or something is wrong with my device. That would be odd, because the same thing is happening on my old device and my friend's new device. So, is Amazon doing this deliberately so people have to purchase an upgrade? Or have they simply been having problems with this for over a month now that they just can't seem to figure out? You take your pick. My ten-year-old could code better. Amazon has reached the point where you have to purchase Amazon in order to purchase from Amazon. You have to purchase Prime in order to purchase shows on Prime. Pretty soon you will have to purchase Amazon in order to purchase Amazon in order to make a purchase through Amazon. How much more money does Jeff Bezos need?

Lo & behold: this thing is amazing! Set up is a snap, & since we have Prime, it can access the entire Amazon Music catalog. It will play ANYTHING you ask it to, specifically,(i.e. play Peter Gabriel, or play Elton John music from the 70's) or generally,(i.e. play classical music, or play jazz form the 50's). The sound quality is fine (for what this is) - clear as a bell. The microphones are spectacular; one echo dot in my kitchen can hear me from any room in the (3br/2bath 1800sqft) house. Not sure why you'd ever put 1 in every room, except to use as an intercom. Does everything it said it would; makes phone calls, sends messages, adds or removes events to google calendar, sets timers/reminders/alarms, gives weather reports/commute times, tells jokes. Although I intended to put this back in the box after figuring out set-up, & save it in case my mother in law ever wanted a 2nd unit, we have decided we like it, & have kept it active:) A pleasant surprise, & for a really reasonable price ( was on sale for $24.99) Actually bought another 1 for my aunt...lol.

You can even technically start your coffee, adjust your thermostat, unlock doors, preheat oven, and even vacuume your house, all without having to lift a finger...just by using your voice. Some features require smart home devices. Super customizable. Even has a sort of app store with it, where it can learn or you can get blueprints: to create new skills for the device to use. Such as headspace, meditation, listen to your favorite podcasts, even soothing sounds for the dog while your away. I expecially love the black model, really nice and super sleek. Makes the changing colored lights look really dope on the black because it stands out and seems to be even brighter then the white model. Anyways, if you set it up right and dont belive that its listening to you 24/7 (which its not)...then it's one of the best products for that price I've ever owned.

Sometimes it'll quit playing during the first song or it'll play music for hours. I don't understand why it's this unreliable. That is the biggest downfall for me. It just glitches. And the majority of issues comes when playing music.It does restart itself more often than it should.When asking a question for information, it gets confused often.I do love how it can learn over time. For example. I have four WiFi light bulbs and one WiFi smart plug. I have tried renaming the light bulbs because Alexa seems to get confused. Now I just say ""Alexa, turn on living room lights"" and the AI has learned what devices. It's still quite blotchy and gets confused. I have labeled my lights as 'light 1', 'light 2', 'light 3', and 'light 4'. When I want them to turn on or off I'll say ""Alexa turn _ living room lights"".Overall I am pleased with my purchase.

One upstairs and one downstairs.  Our old house has a lot of built-in lights and at this time they are not controlled with Alexa.  At first, we did not know how to set up the system, or what words to use, when we got the dots.  After a few youtube videos, and chatting with friends, we feel as though we are doing okay in using the system.  To control the outlets we purchased some 3rd party (tp-link) outlet (3 per pack) which required a different app to be installed that allows Alexa to operate them.  So far no issues with the apps and we have good control of the of these plugs.  My Samsung TV is one generation back and cannot connect to Alexa.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I have a slew of 1st and 2nd gen Dots - more than I need, really. But I ended up having a scenario where it would be nice to be able to pair a FireTV with a Dot to pipe the sound through, and looked into the ""Home Theater"" function which pairs a 3rd Gen Dot with newer Fire Sticks and TVs. Short version: it doesn't work, so avoid if that's your intention.---About Home Theater---We have a Fire Stick that the app will see as available to use for Home Theater, but when I try to select this new 3rd Gen Dot it is greyed out and says it is incompatible. I also have another Stick on the same network that isn't that old, but it isn't even an option to try pairing anything to.  I'm so tired of Amazon's ""ecosystem"" of devices working so incredibly poorly with one another.Their Connect voice quality sucks, this feature sucks, the compatibility between generations for something as seemingly simple as playing an audio stream from FireTV on your Dot? Sucks. I'm not sure why they can't get it working on older devices, but that's annoying. What's more annoying is when you buy a product specifically for the task, which Amazon says should work, only to find it doesn't.---Sound Quality---These 3rd Gen dots still sound really quite poor - if you want to listen to music, you'll still have to output them to a dedicated speaker or suffer weak, muddy sound that lacks both clarity and depth. When you compare to something like a $15ish Logitech X50 bluetooth speaker, I have no idea how this thing can be AC powered and still sound so crappy in comparison. It's better than the earlier gens, but that isn't hard to do as the sound quality was quite possibly the worst sound I'd ever heard.---Conclusion---Ultimately, I'm done trying. I'll find another way. The features compared to Google Assistant based speakers are entirely lacking, and the sound quality still isn't good enough. Glad I got this Dot on the cheap because it allowed me to learn not to invest in Amazon devices like this anymore. Each generation ends up siloed from previous ones so you'd have to buy newer ones for simple additions, and even then they don't even work!Disappointing.","December 12, 2019",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",3.0 out of 5 stars,"This dot is I interesting.  I only bought this because it was almost free with my best buy rewards.  However,  it served a purpose that I was needing.  Working from home now, I wanted to listen to music from my speaker while I worked, but I also had to occasionally answer my phone.  This meant I would have to  get to my tablet and pause it b4 I could answer phone. I kept thinking about how nice it would b if I could say, ""sort music"" and it would stop.  Echo Dot was my answer.  After using this for that one reason, I was good if I never got anything else from this.  However, that was not the end.  Whe I bought the Dot, I received a free Sengled smart light bulb.  Nearly a month later, I looked unto how to use it.  Love it.  Looking to buy more on sale over the holidays.  I know Alexa can do a lot more than this, play my songs on Pandora and tell me what the weather is through Echo Dot. I will find out eventually.","November 18, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",1.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought a fourth-generation Echo because I've been very happy with each of the generations improvement of their Echo products. I have had Echos and Dots since generation 1.However, I was completely disgusted with the latest Echo. So I replaced it with a third-generation Dot.This third-generation Dot has been working like a champ in every aspect. While the sound quality isn't nearly as good as the Echo, including the fourth-generation Echo, everything else has been outstanding.I was using Echo devices (first and second generation, finally the fourth-generation as I mentioned) to provide voice control of various devices. With this third-generation Dot, I am achieving phenomenally fast response with the variety of devices that I'm controlling. Noticeably faster response. I am also achieving much higher recognition rates than any of the previous devices that I've been using.Bottom line, if you're only interested in playing music through these devices, then the Echo is the way to go. However, if you're like me, and controlling devices is the paramount use for these devices, then go with a third-generation Dot!","May 3, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R

(To say the least, it's appreciation of my poorly pronounced Spanish sir-names (Music Artists) is amusing.)Small Footprint is small enough to fit almost anywhere without being obtrusive.The Bad: It lacks an internal memory function that allows it to remember and repeat information it has just delivered or performed - you can't ask it to repeat what it has just said. (This shocked me, and I believe it is a significant flaw that should be addressed in future releases.)It doesn't appear to have any logic circuitry, instead relying on a massive database of references and some basic cross-referencing to find and retrieve data with the Alexa integration. It does a decent job most of the time, but with smarter programming, it could be much better.A computer that isn't really intelligent.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have mainly Google/android products. When Sirius XM offered the Echo Dot as a freebie for renewing my membership, I thought I would do a little comparison. The sound quality is nearly the same. Echo offers a of programs and games the same as Google. I can connect to my favorite podcasts with both. Both have some difficulty picking the exact podcast I request. They both want to play the most recent episodes and not pull up any others when given a voice command. The one thing I like the most about the Echo is its ability to connect to my Prime account, specifically my music. The Google requires membership for other programs especially the fee ones. I have a lot of basic apps such as Spotify and don't want to pay the extra fee to upgrade. So when I ask for a certain singer or song I am told a membership is required ""but here is a station that plays....."". With the Dot, I can ask for something specific and that is what I will get. It will also tell me about my pending purchases, shipping etc. But Amazon already communicates very well by email and text on any purchases so it is a bit redundant. So in short...If I wasn't already so immersed in the Google world with my android phone, tablet and TV, I would switch to the Dot.","January 17, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

Not bad at all from a tiny box with just one tiny speaker.  I'm impressed.Glad I can use my Amazon Prime Music with this device.  2 million songs is better than nothing.  I've linked the Dot with my SiriusXM and Pandora accounts.  All set ups were relatively painless.  Alexa is very responsive.  Learned quickly, only way to turn off the Dot (and it's listening) is to unplug it.  Don't know if I'll buy a second Dot or move up to the Echo Studio.Only one complaint:  Sound levels seems inconsistent.  One song will be loud, next song less loud and so on.  No way I can see to force the product to have same sound level for all songs.  Not a deal breaker as ""Alexa, volume down,""  ""Alexa, volume up"" works just fine.Disclaimer:  Was lucky enough to score a free Echo Dot by subscribing to a streaming music service.","February 6, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"TL:DR - This is a perfectly fine bluetooth speaker and well worth what I paid for it (99 cents with an Unlimited Music subscription of 7.99 which you can immediately cancel if you wish) but don't expect voice command functionality to impress.To be frank, I didn't buy this device to listen to the weather, control the lights in my house, or operate a home security system.  My phone can tell me the weather, and light switches and manual locks have worked fine so far.  I got this because I like listening to music or videos while I cook, clean, and work on the computer at my table.  So basically I'm in it for a bluetooth speaker.  And I have to say, it's kind of neat to have a bluetooth speaker that accepts voice commands.  The problem is in how it responds to those voice commands.Me: ""Alexa, set the volume to fifty percent.""Alexa: ""Sorry, you can only set the volume between zero and ten.""Me: ""Alexa, what is fifty percent of ten?""Alexa: ""Fifty percent of ten is five.""This is the problem I've had with every voice assistant I've encountered so far.  You can't speak to them in everyday language using simple concepts that a computer should be able to understand.  Alexa should be smart enough to know that fifty percent is the same as five out of ten.  If you can't give the device simple, direct commands and have those commands be understood, then why have voice control?As far as a speaker goes, this is about what you would expect from a bluetooth speaker of this size.  You're not going to get clear and sparkling highs, but the overall sound is strong and there's the perfect amount of bass response if like me you enjoy music but also live in close quarters and aren't trying to disturb the neighbors.5 stars for Voice recognition - It knows what I'm saying.2 stars for Alexa integration - The device understands my words, but it doesn't know what they mean or act on them.4 stars for Sound quality - I hoped for a bit more clarity, but this is perfectly adequate for a speaker of this size and cost.","December 14, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

But even so, I'd still use it. It's my news radio, my jukebox, my research assistant, my spell checker, my dictionary, my game partner, my cell phone finder, my weatherman, my delivery monitor - and I haven't even explored a tenth of what it can do. The other night I was in a home where a cat had knocked their Alexa off a shelf onto the floor between the couch and a wall. Someone saw it was missing from the shelf and asked where the Alexa was, I said maybe one of the cats had knocked it onto the floor. Then I called out,  ""Alexa, are you on the floor?"" And it answered,  ""I'm on the floor, and there's one cat down here.""  No, seriously.

The sound quality is amazing and miles ahead of most Bluetooth speakers on the market in the same price range. I am able to use this in my office so I can keep up with current events, listen to music while working on projects, or even have Alexa do a little research for me. Audiobooks and podcasts both sound great and keep me occupied and since this takes very little space it is easily able to sit on a corner of my desk or I can mount it under my desk with a bracket so it stays out of sight. A great purchase for anyone young or old, familiar with technology or not, or as a fairly inexpensive gift. Buy it, you won’t regret it.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know what I did before I got it.I recieved the echo for for Christmas and was initially unsure of how to use it or if I even really would. At first it was really simple stuff like asking it to remind me of stuff, laundry would be done in 55 minutes, remind me to drink water in an hour (I am chronically bad at forgetting to stay hydrated), what time was it, when I'd be snuggling with the cats and couldn't easily get to my phone. It was actually super useful. Then I took a few minutes to link my calendar account and spotify, and suddenly I was using it to listen to music and add events to my calendar. It's so intuitive and easy. I love never having to physically add another event to my phone ever and being able to ask what I've got on my calendar. I've barely had it for a month and I already know there are only going to be more uses for the echo as time goes on. I'm already looking into getting smart lighting and devices for my home, because I can only imagine how nice it would be to turn the light on and off without ever having to get out of bed.

There are so many use cases that I find what hinders the echoes performance, if anything, is just my lack of understanding of everything that it can do, and all its commands. You can get into the game real fast by having one of these, a couple smart bulbs, and smart switches- but it’s way more than being able to turn something on or off- I have two echoes as of now (and plan on getting more) and one of our favorite features so far is being able to connect them and use it for music to play throughout the whole house. The other feature we thought was useful was the intercom feature- it’s easy to let everyone know dinner is ready no matter where they are in the house.They have good range so as long as you place your echoes strategically they can cover a lot of ground.

I speak to a lot of people from other countries and some don't speak very much English.  To be able to put Alexa in ""translation mode"" and have her communicate between 2 languages... well epic!!!2. Battery power. Even a small amount would be great.  Transitional power even. So you can take her one room to the next without losing your current book or Playlist.  But i guess the idea is for us to put one in every room.  What about the car?Whwther or not you're a techie or into gadgets, you'll love this.

Alexa now runs my house lol. We have an Echo dot in every room. I have all the lights and plug sockets hooked up to voice commands using the Echo Dot. I didn't do it because of laziness I did it because of safety believe it or not. We recently got a puppy and I kept tripping over dog toys in the middle of the night. Now I can use a voice command to turn on the lights so I don't trip over dog toys any longer. The only drawback is that sometimes it doesn't hear me.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I purchased Alexa because I’ve heard numerous things about how great it is from friends and family and how it supposed to make life easier. I wasn’t disappointed, but I also won’t say my expectations were met. My biggest problems with Alexa is how often she turns on or interrupts when she was never called upon. I can be watching a movie or a YouTube video and she turns on and says something. A lot of times I’m alone and in my bed and that’s very scary, but that’s not the worst of it. Around 1:00PM Alexa randomly seems to start reading me the daily news and I’m soo confused.... I don’t remember ever setting up something like that. Once again I get scared easily and this doesn’t help. I also cannot stand the default voice of Alexa. You’d think that with the amount of money Amazon has that they would allow for you to pick from a wide variety of voices. Alexa sounds too monotone and robotic for my liking. She’s also a bit high pitched which can be annoying. It’ll be a great improvement if we can get different voices for Alexa! Lastly, I’m also troubled by the amount of privacy concerns I have read and seen about Alexa. It’s always on the back of my mind, and it doesn’t help when I’m sleeping and I happen to wake up and see a yellow or blue ring around Alexa. I can’t help but think what it’s doing. I’ll have to go and check my history. I’m someone whose very interested in technology, I’m always looking to try out new tech, and while I’m glad I tried out Alexa, I can also just as easily live without it.","May 28, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, this is my first Alexa device. I'd been holding out because I'd witnessed my friends struggle with earlier versions of Alexa, yelling at it when it didn't obey a voice command and I wasn't impressed by the sound.But, Amazon had a great sale on the Dot so I figured I'd try it out.  The sound quality is amazing. I can't believe this little thing has such a big sound.The voice recognition is really good too. I rarely have to repeat a command and it recognizes even the most brief command from me. For instance, first thing in the morning I'm groggy and mumble ""Computer, Lana DelRay"" and it plays Lana DelRay easily.I call it ""Computer"" because you can change the wake word options on this model.  Your choices are Alexa, Amazon, Echo or Computer. I chose Computer because I'm a Trekkie and addressing the device like Jean-Luc Picard makes my inner nerd happy. I assume that's why they made that option available in the first place.I like the Skills. Particularly the morning skill. I can say Good Morning and it gives me the weather, calendar and news.I don't use the ""Tell Me Joke"" skill or anything like that, but there are a couple of fun Star Trek skills you can add that are fun.All in all I'm very happy with this device. I may have to buy a smart plug for my lamp and expand Alexa's responsibilities.","September 4, 2019",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I own a 2nd gen Echo Dot and bought a 3rd gen about a week ago, here are the comparisons:pros:1) the sound quality is noticeably better. I think people who are griping about the sound quality are those who expect this Echo to play music and fill out an entire large living room. That is an unrealistic expectation. Look at the size of this thing. The sounds are richer and the bass is fuller. It plays music and it sounds great in my master bedroom.2) shape is improved and it feels more quality than the plastic-y feeling of the previous model.3) the set-up was crazy simple. and it was pretty easy to set up the previous model so that's wild.Here is my 1 CON:The 2nd gen Dot connected via micro-USB, which is a pretty simple and universal cord.The 3rd gen, however, uses what seems to be a dedicated cord for Echos only. I do not like that. In the event I need a new cord, I will need to go to Amazon and only Amazon for a replacement. For that, it's 4 stars for an otherwise fantastic product.Maybe I'm being crazy, but I want to put the info out there for you to decide.","January 5, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pros & ConsPros:- Voice recognition- Easy set up- Wireless Connection- Not bad sound quality- Able to turn off micCons- No internal battery (Did not say it had one)- Software has MANY issues (will go into in review)- Sound is not SUPER loud- Quality deteriorates at high volumeSo I have not had this long, having arrived mid day the just the day prior (had about 1.5 days now) but I have had many issues with it. I thought it would be better, being the third gen. I'll start with the issues with it, and then go on to what I like.I have been using it with Spotify, as well as a speaker for my computer. For Spotify, numerous times it has just not done what I told it. Its playing a playlist, I say ""Play %s from Spotify"", where %s is whatever, does not actually matter. It says Sure playing *whatever said* and then the music pauses for a brief second, and goes back to playing whatever it was playing before, with no change. The device heard me, recognized what I said, acknowledged it was requested to do it, and then did nothing. I would try numerous times in a row, and it would still not do as it was meant to (Again this is a software issue). Next, using it as a speaker. Numerous times it just stops playing sound. I change my speaker back to the built in sound on my laptop, and sound comes out, switch it back to the echo, and nothing. My laptop has no issue having sound come out, and the music is playing, the echo just refuses to output it. I have restarted the laptop, and messed around with the sound settings nothing changes it. I've changed what app the sound is coming out of, still nothing. The solution I've found, is unplugging the echo and plugging it back in, but I could have to do this even up to 3 times an hour. To me, that proves the issue is the echo, not the laptop. Of course, the issue is not always present.So onto the good. The devices voice recognition is honestly not bad, but I would say if you have an accent, lisp, or mumble, it will have lots of issues. Now that may improve with time, but that I cannot speak to. The set up is easy, all it requires is the mobile app, or I believe it can be accessed via a web page. Their is many features/apps one can install so it may interact (aka Spotify). It does not need to be connected to ones phone to work, which is nice. It has a button to turn off the mic, so it will no longer listen/record. I quite like that, but I cannot speak to whether it actually does stop listening and recording, I'd almost be willing to bet it doesn't, but idk.I got it with the special deal with amazon music unlimited, so I spent almost $10 all in all (one month music included). For that price it may be worth it, but I would absolutely not pay 40/50+ for this, especially with all the issues. As a whole not happy with the device so far. If anything changes, I will update this review to reflect.I will say, their customer service is absolutely wonderful. I got a call from them with regards to my issues mentioned above, before this review even went live.","June 18, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"We owned a first-gen Echo Dot and loved it. When the new version came out, we liked the improved aesthetics and the fact that the Dot now features a better built-in speaker. Upgrading allowed us to get rid of the under-mount stereo we had the old Dot plugged into, since the speaker quality on the new device is excellent. It does get bogged down under heavy bass, but for normal listening and most music there's no distortion, and the sound easily fills a large room at high volume. The new Dot looks much better than the original and blends in better with its surroundings, despite the added size. Alexa voice recognition seems to be on par with older versions of the Dot, which is to say it will pick up what you're saying most of the time. I have noticed, with this Dot on one side of the main floor of the house and the original Dot on the other, both devices do respond to the wake word at times, and about 50% of the time the device farther away carries out the requested action. The limitations of modern AI are real, but the device works great and simplifies a lot of stuff in the kitchen. In short, we love it!","February 9, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"These little speakers are inexpensive little workhorses that have reasonable sound quality and provide rapid voice-activated access to factoids, news & weather, and music. Alexa doesn't always know the answer but continues to evolve. Misunderstandings happen on occasion but become less frequent the more she becomes familiar with your voice. Adding a new one to an existing system with the app sometimes is a little glitchy but other times goes smoothly. I've found it best to do the setup of a new one close to where your WiFi signal is strongest and go ahead and label the device with the intended location and only then to move it to that location. Once in place, and assuming your WiFi doesn't have dead or very weak areas, you can use the mobile app to create various speaker groups and you can then send music to selected areas of your home, or to the entire house, as desired and I love this feature as lots cheaper than a Sonos system. However, I have to say the mobile app is sluggish at times and could stand some improvement. At the same time, I admit my Android cell phone is more than 3 yrs old so not sure if this has anything to do with the sluggishness.","January 22, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R
"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"We bought 3 of these on the $25 sale over the holidays. I was fully expecting a lot more plastic and these feeling very fragile. They're basically built like small tanks. And the sound quality is incredibly impressive. Like mini-stereo systems in each room. Just really nice. We had considered getting a land line also, but this essentially acts as a phone also. Our kids call us from the Echo. It's just impressive.The only small gripe I have is that when you connect the dot to your TV to act as a speaker, it turns off the TV audio. It would be nice if these could be used as something akin to a sounder or speaker in another part of the room, just for extra punch.It would be nice also if the wall mount were priced accordingly to the Echo. It seems a bit steep for a piece of plastic. Would make sense to have it be like 7-8 bucks.We also just connected Tidal with zero effort. Pandora, Tidal, etc all work pretty flawlessly. The Charcoal is just a really nice, neutral, modern color that fits in pretty much anywhere. The kids love it. It's basically the best sound system for a kids room I can think of. Small and discrete and very functional for a small kid.","January 23, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a review for the device, and more importantly, Amazon Music and Alexa android apps.I received this as a promotion from Amazon where I got this for 99c with a subscription to Amazon Music at $9.99/mo.First off, the device itself seems pretty nice, the sound quality is good, but voice recognition is lousy. Even after training it.However, as this was to be used for Amazon Music and podcasts, it is beyond useless. Voice recognition doesn't recognize artists names or track titles. After several retries you are better off just going to the Amazon Music app.But, and here is where the issue is, the Amazon Music app and Alexa app are garbage. Absolutely terrible. Amazon Music somehow has screen refresh issues. It fails to load the screen, or goes into some dizzying refresh cycle where it loads over and over and over. That or it just displays a black screen.If you are lucky enough to actually find a track or artist you want to play, then hit the play buttonn, there is a rediculously long delay on the order of 5-10 seconds where it thinks about doing it.And then the buffering, oh the buffering. It appears they don't use one. It repeatedly skips and pauses, even on a a 280Mbs WIFI signal and 4G cell service. Its useless.And then, it will crash on you.And for the Alexa app, it crashes repeatedly. I have to click the ""close app"" button when Android indicates it has crashed in the background. This occurs roughly 4-5x per day.So, here I am with a device that seems capable, but the applications to use with it are garbage. What an ecosystem! Way to go Amazon. Hire some real developers please.I canceled my music subscription immediately. There's $10 wasted. Now I have a device that I was hoping to use for music and podcasts, and now I can't.Avoid if you plan on using this for music streaming.","January 19, 2022",United States,B07FZ8S74R

The new Echo Dot sits on my nightstand and was very simple to install, connecting to our network quickly and easily. It's a welcome addition to our system and does exactly what we were hoping for.  One minor issue that we are not sure how to resolve is that sometimes when we are in the living room talking to Alexa using the Echo Studio that sits in our living room, Alexa's reply will come from the Echo Dot in our bedroom. It has only happened 3 or 4 times in a couple weeks, and not sure if it is cause by the Echo Dot or the Echo Studio.

The 3rd gen is not too much bigger, but both the volume and the quality of the sound is so much better. It won't flip your wig or anything,  but I was pleasantly surprised at the fullness of the sound given it's size. I noticed a couple of reviews that said the second gen sounded better or they were better able to hear the second gen.  I can only assume it's easier for them to hear because the second gen has zero midbass making the higher tones easier to hear without the competing lower frequencies. For myself, I can hear the 3rd gen across the room, where I struggled hearing gen 2 unless the room was somewhat quiet. Definitely worth the upgrade, especially on sale.

It's louder than I thought. Now, will it win any audiophile awards, of course not; that's why you buy the Dot's big brother. It does play music quite well enough that I don't have a problem with it. Creating routines is a breeze and can be quite fun. The skills you can get are great (although pay attention to the reviews, some are junk), All of this adds up to making the Echo Dot an amazing way to start building up your future smart home.I recently paired them up with smart bulbs and now I have almost everything I want for my home.If you are looking for a great way to enter into smart home tech and don't want to spend a fortune?

I haven't talked to a help representative yet on the timer issue, but when I spoke to a help agent regarding the Sleep Sounds issue she was not very knowledgeable or helpful and didn't get the problem fixed.

Then I can just tell Alexa to play my Unlimited Music, or stream Prime Video, major networks (ABC,CBS, Fox, NBC, ESPN, and Sling) and rarely need to use the remote control.Media System: 24"" LG TV, Fire TV Stick $30, Echo Dot 3 $19, Dell Speakers w/Sub $70.

They worked very well for several months until I finally tried to set up the stereo feature.  It has been downhill ever since.  I have told Alexa that she better behave or start packing.I lost most of my programed responses that I added to the Skills or Blueprint.  Controlling my smart plugs failed.  Reset that up and now it is hit or miss.A big issue for me is the capability of asking to play an individual song is no longer available.  Then I have to listen to her long speech about paying for Music Unlimited to have that feature back.  I have never and will never pay a monthly fee to hear music.Now I also have to listen to commercials which never happened in the past.  I have a suspicion that eventually, once many users are hooked, everyone will have to pay to listen to music.I am now resorting to pulling her plug when one of the long sales pitches starts or a commercial comes on.  It takes more time for the re-connection,  but that is how annoyed I feel.Looks like I may have to reset the triplets of Alexa  and start over.I would rather have no stereo and all the functions working like before.","April 27, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R

I was hooked.  I ordered six more echos.  I ordered smart light bulbs and Smart light switches, smart thermostat and smart plugs and Ring cams.  It won’t end.  Now Alexa is everywhere. Listening.  Judging me. Watching.  Probably waiting for the right time to strike a blow in America’s heartland.  It’s a slow process. But Alexa is patient.  I’m so lazy now I don’t get up to turn the light off or change my thermostat. I can even see who’s at the door from my couch.  I’m gaining weight slowly.  And in a few decades I’ll die, probably of heart disease.  The calories I burned moving around and now being stored.  My LDL is out of whack.

Each unit's name is in ().  All they have to do from any room in the house is have that unit call either upstairs or basement and we communicate perfectly.  In addition, it's nice to get the news or weather or to listen to my choice of music in any room.  I also use Alexa to place phone calls to anyone listed in my cell phone directory and the Echo Dots are just like speaker phones throughout the house.  I also use Alexa to tell me the time and to provide me with quick conversions such as ""How many tablespoons are there in a cup""?

Also I never gave consent for Amazon to “pool” my Wifi for my neighbors Sidewalk is a big fat PERMISSION NOT GRANTED!!Original review:I bought this through an Amazon deal at Best Buy. I received 2 for the price of 1 and got 2 smart bulbs as well, during their “early Black Friday deals”. Let me start by saying I wanted this for 2 reasons and it disappointed on both. 1)To make calls for work to the carriers (most require to push “x” to get to the correct area and this won’t do that :( ) it works for the carriers I don’t have to select a choice or to call my account reps ect. Sound quality is spot on and it does a great job on listening in on meetings ect to take notes so I trade one for the other. 2) to use to listen to music and pod casts as I work or sleep. If Alexa would pick a better variety then this would be perfect. But example: I say Alexa play 80’s music and it chooses the exact same station that plays the exact same songs over and over. If I say “Country Love Songs” it plays the Country Love category on my IPhone gahhh. Alexa doesn’t seem to understand certain things and the routine and tasks I added don’t seem to work. Idk I will mess with this one a little more as I am new to all of this but it’s frustrating and may be returned. Best part: you can mute the echo and no accidentally calling or recording a call or conversation and I can “drop in” and make sure my home is safe when I am away.","November 12, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

This would have been a deal-breaker had I known it going in.There is little to no management of individual devices.The trigger words are often misheard in general conversation, leading to general nonsense.Downs (Minor):Connectivity is an occasional issue, often requiring a manual reboot.(Amazon, if you are listening and tell me to check my network, I will tell you to sit in the corner.)Voice Recognition is functional, but you must know how to address it.The rules:  #1 - Background conversation must not be happening. This includes radio or TV. Volume does not matter.  #2 - Background noise must be as minimal as possible.  #3 - Speak the trigger word, then wait a second before the command. A 2-count is fine.  #4 - Enunciate with exaggeration! Monotone will not pass with Amazon. Use that stage voice!  #5 - Do not pause while speaking the command.Whisper mode is a lie.Amazon knows very little about pricing and information about Amazon services.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,My son bought this for me for Christmas. At first it seemed to work fine. I have terrible ringing in my ears and a little hard of hearing so she is hard to understand sometimes. I wish there was a way to adjust the pitch of her voice.  I do like the sound of the speakers when playing music.  I have reminders set which have worked awesome until today all the sudden they were all had just disappeared. I had to re add them. No clue what happened as my routines were still there. The routines that play music I have a lot of problems with play on my AMAZON PLAYLIST. The routine will either not start or it will cut off short of what was scheduled. This happens for all the music I have set which is 4 of them at various times of day. The routines set that are non music seem to work great like my smart plug. Although I want my volume set to 5 during the day (after playing night music at 2) and when set in the routine she does not do it. I really have a love hate relationship with her at this point as I have to  manually start my songs majority of the time.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I don't know why I waited so long!! We live in a multi story house and will be using these as our intercom system. Hopefully one day Alexa will partner up with more home security companies, like Xfinity, so those under contracts will be able to use the security voice commands. But for now, the guard is still a pretty neat feature. It's also nice to know that the echo dot can pair up with your current Bluetooth speakers! I had to YouTube how to do it bc it's a process initially setting up, but once your Bluetooth devices have been saved in your dots system, it is merely a simple command every time after that. And the Alexa voice commands (Alexa, search Crowder on Pandora) will still work through the dot when it's paired with the Bluetooth speaker! For that reason I will be ordering the wireless battery pack for the dot so that I can have her outside on the bartop at our parties/BBQs and guests can command songs/stations they want to hear like a jukebox and the music will play out of our existing outdoor installed Bluetooth speakers.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,We purchased our Echo Dot with a subscription to Sirius XM radio. It was intended for my wife. The first day we had it she used it non-stop. Since then I have used it almost every night to put on soothing classical music for our 9 month old son and rain sounds for myself. I have used the shopping list function a few times but don't fully understand the Alexa mobile app. I plan on purchasing more of these. I read somewhere that we can use them as an intercom system which I find very useful being a parent. I don't like to yell throughout the house for one or both of our other children. The only issue I am having is the alarm volume. I simply do not hear the alarms that I set with it going off.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,Ooof the learning curve... That being said this has the potential of making your house feel like The Jetsons. I've ordered two more because of the birthday deals. It should be quite interesting to see if they will integrate with my lights and devices. I've noticed that I enjoy the multicolored lights that Costco is selling. They are 60 watts can do warm and daylight as well as millions of colors in between. Those have been the best paired with the Amazon Dot. I have three different manufactures lights and the ones from Costco were the easiest to put together on the network. It's all about making routines with an Amazon dot. Once you learn how to make a routine sky's the limit on really what you can do. Right now when one of my friends comes over I have Alexa talking trash to him via the Xbox. It's fantastic.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I am (unfortunately) fully invested in Amazon devises.  I have at least one echo in every room of my house, and a fire stick on every tv.  A total of 12 echos/dots/shows plus an echo sub and 6 fire sticks.  When they work right, they are a wonder of technology.  For a fraction of the price of a Sonos, you can have whole home audio, plus integration with light switches and bulbs as well as home automation.  I use the echos for my shopping lists, reminders, alarms and timers, as well as checking sports scores and weather and even asking what time it is if I’m too lazy of roll over and look at my phone.  Firesticks also play nice with echos (for the most part) so in my garage, I have a nice sound system with two echos for atmos stereo sound and a subwoofer connected to my projector and I don’t need to have any wiring except the hdmi to the fire stick and the power cables running to the echos.  Soooo why 2 stars?  Well, despite all these neat things they can do, that is their job.  That’s why I have over $500 invested into this system.  Ya, that’s a good price for what I have but that’s if these things worked correctly all the time.  Thing is, they only work right about 50% of the time.  Using Alexa is terrible.  It’s the biggest flaw.  It just doesn’t hear things right and if it were human, I would say it is one of the most stubborn people I know.  I am constantly repeating commands multiple times.  Sometimes I will be right in front of one talking in a bedroom and you get a response from one two rooms over.  It is an issue with alarms because you don’t want a kitchen alarm going off in someone’s bedroom, etc.  the other issue is audio drop-outs.  I will just randomly lose audio in different rooms.  Even right next to the router while other things are streaming.  Then it gets stubborn and won’t comeback until you go into another room and tell it to start up again in the room you want.  If you don’t, it will keep telling you it’s playing what you requested but just goes silent.  Tech support is a joke.  Protocol for everything is (turn everything off, router, modem, firesticks, echos and restart.  Ok, I do that and most of the time it fixes it but when these things happen again and again and again.  Spending 30 minutes doing that is not a solution.  They just need to make a better product.  Anyways, I’ve seen plenty of people say “oh I have no problems”. Ok good for you, and if you only have one echo dot, ya, you probably won’t see as many issues.  I’m just saying, I’ve had 100’s and 100’s of tech devises and these (though they can do some neat things) are way too problematic to be satisfied with.  If I could do it over, I’d have gone with Google products for my smart home.","September 16, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

(I got my Google Nest Mini free for being a Youtube Premium subscriber before this). So I pretty much went more toward google but figured i would get this since it was free. Google has 'routines' which i find to be easier to setup than the Echo Dot. But the Echo Dot seems to be more intuitive for the commands to get things done. I always have issues with choosing the correct command on the Google Nest Mini to the point where i'm frustrated, but the Echo Dot seems to know what i want better. It also listens for commands better; when i say Alexa... she is ready to go. When i say OK Google... not so much.Overall, if I had received the Echo Dot first, i probably would have gone all in and would use it more often.

The sound quality, I can say, is the best so far for a speaker like this. The sound is crystal clear and I can hear every detail coming from those great speakers, I have nothing to say except that you will not have trouble hearing the highs, mids, and lows produced from this speaker and will be satisfied with the sound quality.  Overall, the Echo Dot 3rd Generation from Amazon is by far the best smart speaker out the market out there,  and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!

These are very good improvements.  However, I like to listen to podcasts and talk or news radio, and when I do the sound has a heavy base and is muffled.

I have attempted to use the apps equalizer, to minimize the base and enhance the mid-range and treble, but don't hear any significant improvement.  Music does sound just fine, however.

I appreciate the option to mute the mic, but do not like eat red light on all night, especially in a very dark room like the bedroom when sleeping. Also, unplugging it each night as a turn-off option is not very functional, especially if you plan to use it for alarms to early morning activities. So here is my creative solution, so feel free to use it. I plugged my echo into a wifi smart plug that I have setup on timer to turn-off at my bedtime and turn-on before I arise in the morning. That way, I can start the day with giving Alexa commands and not feel as though she is listening to everything that I do throughout the night. :-) This appears to be the best solution for me right now until Amazon comes up with an option to turn the device on and off. If anyone else has any ideas, I would love to hear them. Keep in mind this is more about privacy during quite hours than anything else, so keep that in mind if you decide to comment.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"We have both the Amazon Echo Dot and the Google Home. Some Pros: It can pick up my voice more reliably and seemingly from a greater distance than the Google Home. It gives you notifications for things like when an Amazon package has been delivered. It can play more specific song requests when I have a Prime subscription, but less when I don't have the subscription. It can read me a book from my Audible list and fast forward, pause, and rewind. And it can can add things on to your Amazon shopping list. Some Cons: it is more limited as to information it can provide compared to Google Home. Google is an internet server and Amazon is not, therein lies a great difference. The app is hard to figure out how to use when integrating it with other devices in the home, like being able to control a Whirlpool range or smart lights, and I still haven't been able to figure out how to do that because it's not intuitive like the Google Home app. So I control all other devices with the Google Home app. But we would buy it again.

I'm having fun learning all she can do and it's still to soon to really review it but I have very early on discovered a very big, disappointing flaw I have to vent about.  I need to pick up my granddaughter at one time on Mon, Tues, Thurs & Fri and another time on Weds.  Unless I missed something, there is no way to set an alarm/reminder/notification/routine or whatever to do that on the Dot????  It's either every weekday or individually.  I guess once you got each one set up, it wouldn't be that big a deal but what about when her schedule changes, as it often does and you have to do it all over again.  I'll bet there are others out there who have different schedules thruout the week that will find it a pain also.  Or is my situation unique?  Having to set up an individual repeating alarm (or whatever) for Mon, then another one for the same time Tues, then another one for the same time Thurs, then another one for  the same time Fri and then still another different one for a different time on Weds is, ahem, less than ideal.  And you can't even exclude weekends!What were they thinking?  For something as 'smart' as this device is supposed to be, this is a really stupid omission.  Not everyone gets up at the same time everyday and we do have repeating schedules based on given days.  So right now, all my Dot does is turn off/on lights.

The answers sometimes take quite a while, whilst Alexa reads lengthy articles verbatim. Actually, a bit irritating when one is hoping for a yes or no.On the other hand, having three sets up a nice sound system in the house that allows me to go from room to room and enjoy music or discussions w/o missing much. Because Hubby can't quite get the hang of not mentioning Alexa's name, thus triggering her, I've enabled the Study to answer to ""Computer,"" so I feel quite Captain Kirk-ish saying, ""Computer, do this!"" I'd've preferred an option to choose other names and have one called Minerva after the sentient computer in Heinlein's ""Time Enough for Love.""  I suppose I'd hoped for a bit more.

Its uses are absolutely unending.My reason for only four stars on this review is related to Amazon policy.  The pin for the speaker jack is out of position and unusable on this item, and when I asked for a replacement, I was told I could only have a refund.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'd give 5 stars but Alexia keeps stopping and sometimes becomes non-responsive. Other times I have to unplug it to get it to respond/play music again but that doesn't always work. I added a second Echo 3rd generation thinking I wanted a stereo sound. I can't do that without a $15.00 subscription so I learned that the hard way. I figured I'd use the second speaker to listen to the TV in the bedroom instead. There is a serious legacy so it is only good if I don't actually watch the TV at the same time. Also, I have to unplug and plug back in to get Alexia to actually play the sound from my TV. Mind you, the TV is an Amazon Fire TV with Alexia built-in. Alexia can turn my TV on but not play sound. It is a pain because it takes a while for Alexia to find my WiFi connection all over again when I unplug it. I should give 3 stars with these complaints but the speaker wasn't too expensive.","November 22, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R
"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"There are many things I love about Alexa. I love how I can think of a song and say “Alexa play me this song” and it starts playing! My 2 year old loves Baby Shark and Wheels on the Bus so it’s very convenient to be able to pull those songs out. Also love when I’m cooking I can say “Alexa set a timer for 30 minutes” and then boom my forgetful butt gets an alarm letting me know dinner is ready. Speaking of forgetful, she even keeps and adds to my grocery list each time I remember to tell her what we need! On top of that, I used to wrestle with plugging the Christmas lights in every year. I would blindly fumble with them until I finally found the outlet. I ordered the smart plug in, linked them, nicknamed it, and said “Alexa, turn the Christmas light on” and voila! lights. Oh and we like to leave some sort of noise on for our dog when we’re not home. The last thing I do now before I leave the house is say “Alexa, turn on 94.7“ and the radio magically starts playing. Defiantly would recommend if you’re a forgetful person or if you just like convenience.","February 23, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

And this one really steps up it’s game. Voice recognition is waaaaaaaaaayyyyy better. Sound is better and so is the integration. We keep this one in our bathroom and use it when we take a shower to listen to music. Plus we have it hooked up with our lights. The voice recognition works well, because I can be in the shower and ask her something and she’s able to respond without us having to yell like we are a football field away. The sound is better too. We have it sitting up a bit on our sink and the sound is a bit clearer. Plus we don’t have to turn it up all the way to hear it. The integration works with our Alexa enabled lights And we can ask it to turn the lights on and use the Amazon app. All-in-all I would say that there could be some more upgrades that’ll make it even better, but what they have now really does pack a punch from the original one.","July 20, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"The idea is that you would “talk to it,” when in reality you give it limited commands, which in practice take more effort that we would really want. They are moving in the right direction but have a long way to go. The sounds quality does exceed what one would think for such a small item and the overall confection of the item is fairly good. It is heavier than it looks and Thai reflects overall good materials. The buttons could be a bit sturdier, to be inline with the overall quality. Given that it is at such a low price point, the use of it as a stand alone speaker that easily interfaces with other devices, and that it does have some benefit in terms of its “smart” capabilities and I think it’s pretty descent. If they charged more then it would go into the rip off category. Watch videos on YouTube and see how it is used.

I set it up under my Amazon account at his house. He plugged it in as soon as he got home.  He wasn’t sure what to do with it. All I could think of was the SNL skit ‘Alexa for Seniors’. If you haven’t seen that, I highly suggest googling it and watching it over and over. Amazon needs to create one of those. Anyways, we ‘dropped in’ on him a few times. He seemed amused. Then when his cable went out he asked Alexa the Celtics score when the game was on. He also started using the timer feature when he was on his exercise bike. The fun part came when his phone service was out. (Do you see a pattern with Comcast? 🤔).  He figured out how to call us through his Echo since i linked it to my contact list. Downside is when he reaches my husband the call ID says it’s me.  So hopefully my husband doesn’t answer it in an inappropriate manner for his father. 😂  I can’t wait for his next Echo antics.","January 29, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

But if we're cleaning the whole house, we can tell Alexa to play Pandora ""downstairs"", which right now combines two speakers.Right now I don't really care about having Alexa and all her ""skills"". It's mostly just for music. It is nice to be able to mute the sound quickly when a commercial comes on, or change the volume with a simple command. I may start using more commands in the future as I add technology to the house.I didn't really have any trouble signing up for the app, and I have now connected three different Echo Dots, linked my Pandora account, and renamed and grouped the different speakers. It's been pretty simple so far.The sound quality is pretty good. I'm a fan of bass, and speakers like this rarely have enough for my tastes.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"At the urging of my children, we joined the Alexa crowd with the Echo Dot 3rd Gen in the kitchen.  First, the good things.  Installed easily and unobtrusive on the counter.  Can speak to it in a regular voice and it seems to understand both my wife and me without problems.  Able to create lists for various shopping trips, if we can go, without problems.  Able to stream SiriusXM with stations selected on command, as well as Pandora and Spotify.But ....  the sound quality of the Alexa voice is muddy, and sometimes hard to understand.  I boosted the treble and lowered the bass in the equalizer, did not seem to make much difference.  Not clear that mine is defective, as many others seem to have the same problem.  Although it can interface with a Roku, the commands are quite limited; it can run a Roku application, but not control it once loaded, so you still need the remote.  Seeking information, Alexa is often beaten by Google.  For example, I wanted to know when the local NFL team was playing, it was able to give me the time of the game.  But when I asked for the network broadcasting the game, ""I don't have that information"" was the response.  Google Assistant came through with the correct information.  This has happened with other searches as well.  Disappointing.So, overall, Alexa is good, but not great.  Music played through the speaker is acceptable, but not the Alexa voice.  Commands can be limited.  We have one, not sure if I need another.","December 20, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

It's not super fantastic, but whether music or voice, it sounds great and fills a large room with clear 360 degree sound. I got it solely to listen to my SiriusXM stations. Whether played loud or soft, it is remarkable.  The voice recognition is very sensitive. In fact at certain levels, if a commercial is played and mentions ""Alexa"", the unit prepares itself to listen to commands. Other than that, it's a very recommendable, nice sounding unit; better than my expensive first generation Bose Wave Radio. However, don't feed the interactive A.I. too many successive commands or it will shut down and you will have to reinitialize it by unplugging for a moment. It will, at times, confuse your commands, so speak clearly. The Alexa App is good, you can silently turn on the unit to your desired station, HOWEVER, you have to voice command it to turn off.

I do have SiriusXM as default right now. Just not sure if I want to keep it.It’s great to set reminders! And actually have an alarm, when we have to get up early!I’m planning on getting one of them light bulb for my master bathroom, which would make it easier for me to get up in the middle of the night, and not have to use the light on my tablet!I’m sure my grandsons gonna have a ball next time they visit.

I don’t know anything about these Alexa products, so I went ahead and took it out of the box and set it up so I could show my dad how to use it. Well....the next week I ordered another one for him for $25 because I loved it so much I decided to keep one for myself. It’s really cool and the sound quality is pretty good!  Much better than I expected and the 3rd generation looks so much better than the older models. There are a few things I haven’t figured out yet. I’m still learning how to use it, so I’m not sure if this will be a negative because it doesn’t do certain things, or if I just need to figure it out. Last night I just learned how to connect my phone to the speaker. I haven’t figured out how to play my playlists without manually going on my phone and picking it myself. Whenever I say, “play my playlist”, it does something else. Calling people isn’t as smooth as I would think either. But....for twenty something dollars, it’s the best!  And Amazon is the best.

I grabbed a few GoSund outlets & they pair great for working lamps throughout the house. I was a little disappointed with the integration to FireStick; although the feature works- the echo takes all the audio from my TV. I would like to control it with the dot, but since since the audio is blocked from coming out of the TV, and only out of the dot, the location is in a weird place for tv sound to come from.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have three 1st generation Echo Dots.  I traded two of them with 3rd generation.  The look is much bigger than the first.THE GOOD:The sound for this is good for a small speaker standard.  Although I listen to music connecting it to a Bose Bluetooth, this sound is much better compared to previous generation.THE UGLY:1) ALEXA CAN’T HEAR YOU!!!  I have one in my kitchen’s island, and one top of the bed with 12 inches from my head (from below) while laying down.  While the device hears the “Alexa” call because she beeps and you see the light, she can’t recognize your commands.  If you say “Alexa what did you hear” she’ll tell you she didn’t hear anything in the last minute.  The one in the bedroom is 12 inches from my head and it’s the same thing. The devices will NOT respond to ANY whisper even though she heard “Alexa”.  I don’t know what they did to the microphones but I’m almost certain they downgraded them.2) THE VOLUME.  The 1st generation’s volume was quite pleasant.  You could even set it to 1% from the app.  My bedroom is quiet, so at night I like low volumes.  The 3rd generation can’t seem to be low.  I set the alarm multiple times and that seems to be an issue too.  This is frustrating late at night.Overall the only upgrade is for sound. Everything else is a downgrade from the 1st generation.  If you never had a previous generation, you’ll enjoy it.","October 26, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

As well as you have to purchase an add on to be able to play music on multiple Alexa speakers in the same household for example if my spouse is listening to music in the living room using the Alexa speaker and I have another one in the kitchen that I want to use and listen to a different song It will not let you unless you purchase a family plan again disappointing that it's not included with prime.","December 21, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

Last thing, it will not play music outside of certain apps. I have a YouTube playlist of music, and Apple music on my phone. It will not connect to either of those.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Well, I am happy that I kept myself up with the newest product I found very useful and practical and these smart speakers are just one of them. Unlike many others, I am using the echo environment in parallel with the Google assistant. The main reason of doing so comes from the compatibility issues and what these devices are programmed to cover. Yes, there are many similarities that you can get from both but if you are really into the smart assistant devices then you realize that the differences are remarkable and I wanted to have everything covered and connected so I am using both (Amazon echo and Google assistant). For obvious reasons, way bigger than what I can even encounter in here, Google is dominating the market when it comes to the speed and ease of use smart assistants and Alexa which is still quite better than Siri, Cortana and Bixby are still way far from Google on the second place. A great example of the differences here is like,when you are talking to an adult person vs you are talking to a kid! So with an adult you can speak freely and expect to get a response most likely than you are talking to a kid. I personally can't blame Amazon for what Google has been dominating solely for years and years ahead of everyone else so if you learned how to speak with this kid (Alexa in here), she is going to get the job done accurately and there's more, as I mentioned on the very beginning. It comes from the area of what one particular device covers and it's that important to get your attention to have the more compatible smart assistant for the tasks or other services you are planning to use. The bottom line here is the third generation of echo dot devices are the best of it's own kind and having them in parallel with Google assistant will do almost everything for what is doable in 2019 technology relm.","October 23, 2019",United States,B07FZ8S74R

Multiple brands of ""things"" are now under one system.  Besides using voice commands to turn things on and off, we ask for weather, news, stock market, etc.  We don't need to convince the kids they can't wear shorts everyday.  They just ask Alexa for the temperature before they go out to decide what to wear.  Now, it would be great if Alexa can be configured to respond only to some voices, and allow kids to add voice profiles too.  I wouldn't integrate any locks or door openers with Alexa yet.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Working from home, I figured that an external speaker would improve the Zoom meeting experience compared to tinny laptop speakers, so I ordered an extra Echo Dot for $20 on Prime Day. The experience has been mixed. The Dot paired with my laptop easily and the sound quality was definitely better than the laptop speakers; however, despite the fact that the Dot sits right next to the laptop, the Bluetooth connection is not stable, occasionally disconnecting and reconnecting for no discernible reason (and loudly announcing itself when it reconnects during a meeting).  I thought an easy fix would be to connect the Dot to the headphone jack of the laptop using a 3.5mm cable, but discovered to my dismay that the 3.5mm jack on the back of the Dot is an output only, not an aux input.  In other words, you can use the Dot to play music on external speakers, but you cannot play audio from an external source on the Dot.  To get a jack which handles both output AND input, you need to buy one of the more expensive Echo devices (e.g., the $100 Echo Gen 4 or the $200 Echo Studio).  No thanks.

You have to be fairly precise in what you are requesting Alexa to do. After you get used to that it works pretty well. The integration side of Alexa is the reason I rated it a four. I have had a hard time with Smart lights (Phillips) and my Kindle. The Kindle tends to be slow and not responsive at times. The Hue Bridge works pretty well.Sound Quality is mediocre at best. If you just want background, it is satisfactory. Above that, get a stereo or receiver. Can't speak for the Echo.Because my wife is ill, I bought it to use the intercom feature. Still have not gotten it to work. As I understand it, you have to tell Alexa the echo you want to talk to and then wait for the connection and the other person to answer before you can talk. So it is not just push a button and talk like they make it sound.

I had finally--after a year of arguing with myself--decided to get an Amazon Alexa, but didn't really know that there were multiple versions.  When I searched, the newest one came up--the baseball shaped one.  As always, I went to the reviews to see what people thought.  I read dozens, and the overall feeling was not to get this version, but the previous version, the Echo Dot.  Works great, does everything I wanted it for and more!  I'm ""smartening"" my apartment and love it!  The sound is great and can be adjusted just like a stereo in the app.  It gives me complete answers unlike Siri (my phone) who wants me to drop what I'm doing to head to a website.  I'm even learning to use the fun stuff :)  Very happy and would heartily recommend the Echo Dot.","April 6, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

The sound quality is so above and beyond, it actually sounds closer to my echo.My husband posted the above review comments. (He has no idea I'm editing his review, hehe) I don't disagree with what he said, but I wanted to note that Alexa likes him. She is so much nicer and helpful to him than she is to me. It almost feels like a female thing. For instance, if my husband thanks her for something she ALWAYS gives some kind of cute, friendly response. I kid you not, out of all the times I've thanked the thing I've gotten a total of 2 responses that said ""no problem"".  On top of that, she argues with me sometimes! Well, maybe not argue as much as deny an answer. Ill ask what I think is a well worded, simple question, and she tells me ""hmm, I don't know that one"".Everything my husband said in the beginning of the review is absolutely accurate. My main request is maybe change the voice to a male. Maybe I wouldn't feel like the dang thing wasn't competing that way? I swear she's out for my man.","January 3, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

I have them paired with smart plugs and WiFi enabled light bulbs, but even before the plugs and lights, we used Alexa daily. I locked myself out of the house and would have been late except I was able to ""drop in"" on the Echo in my daughter's room and yell at her to wake up from the Alexa app on my cell phone. She hadn't answered the phone. All those off the wall questions that curious 10 year old kids ask can be answered by asking Alexa now. It almost always finds an answer on the web. Setting alarms, schedules, and reminders are as simple as saying, ""Alexa remind me to take the trash out tomorrow at 5pm"" or ""Alexa, set my alarm for 6 am.""  Its allowed my 10 year old to take a lot more responsibility for his own schedule and gives him a greater sense of independence. We love them.","October 23, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

Our son purchased and set it up for us and while still a bit apprehensive, we quickly learned the value of the Echo Dot.  So many daily routines are made so much simpler by this little gem.  Smart bulbs have allowed for less step running every day.  Reminders have allowed us to not have to write constant notes to ourselves.  While it is nice to have these on a phone, having someone repeat them back to you is far better.  I spend many hours in the kitchen preparing a specialized diet and the use of product identifying timers has already become a lifesaver...no more setting 3 or 4 timers and attempting to remember which was set for what particular food product.  My 80 year old husband has enjoyed hours of listening to old radio shows and taking up challenges offered in various apps.  For me, the available music is a wonderful feature.  Anyone who is on the fence (even if you are seniors like us)..do yourself a favor and get an Echo Dot.","January 30, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

It does the job, we love using it with gadgets, such as smart lights, tv's and so. I love that it shows the time, as well as timers if you have any. The sound quality isn't the best, given the fact that it isn't a JBL or Beats speaker, and the prime function isn't music, but it's average. The sound gets muffled as the volume goes up (nothing too serious). The voice recognition is very good I must say, and love the follow-up feature, when you don't have to keep saying ""alexa"" when asking multiple questions. It has a lot of other features, like reading you the news first time in the morning, shopping list, reminders, alerts you when a package has arrived, you can broadcast messages from the alexa app through your echo dot...to name a few.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"This review has been a LONG TIME COMING! Third generation echo is a piece of crap! It's cheap! It's unresponsive at times! It doesn't hear you very well or doesn't hear you at times at all! The second generation Echo was fast, always responsive, didn't take about half a second to a second to react (it was immediately), even the speaker power was stronger.I've had this piece of crap for 2 years and the 2nd generation for more than 5 years. They basically made a cheaper Alexa and implemented new cheaper features like less volume power when playing music and late response time as if there was a constant lag between you and the echo. I hate this piece of trash! The second generation is my favorite. I don't know how the 4th generation stacks up, but as I'm seeing more and more let's go cheaper, but sell it for more or the same price at Amazon. I'm not holding my breath for an even cheaper 3rd generation wanna be. Buy the second generation if you can or the speaker. DON'T BUY THIS THIRD GENERATION LET'S SAVE ON MONEY TO MAKE MORE MONEY AND SACRIFICE QUALITY FOR CORPORATE GREED, PIECE OF TRASH!!!Also, if you haven't noticed, why do you think they have this echo dot ALWAYS on sale or limited time price or they're giving it away with a 3 months subscription to whatever, keep the piece of trash and cancel the subscription anytime!?

Baffling really.It does help with quizing my 8yr old when she wants to count by say 2s or 5s etc. Helps learn more spelling and so much more upon enabling the item from your phone for the app.Overall Echo is great!

I can stream my Spotify music to it and control volume and skips through voice commands as well. Timers and alarms are loud and useful. The only problems I have with this device, is the lack of useful skills, shotty voice recognition, and an awful app. The app is laggy, unstable, and sometimes doesn't save things you change. There is no really good skills to download for it either, limiting it's capabilities. I wish they had options for different voices, especially different personalities.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"As I write this review I am hoping for a customer service response from Amazon (COVID-19 has email support unavailable), so this is not an attack review.  Purchased 2 units to expand voice coverage in my apartment and within 6 months had one unit begin to malfunction and then fail to be able to connect to any wifi networks. (UPDATE) Unit is working again after being powered down and then reset back to factory standard.  Tech support from Amazon did a great job, as stated above current events just caused some communication difficulty that I do not expect to be standard.Sound quality not as good as a larger Echo device, but that is to be expected.  Perfectly suitable as a deskside or bedside companion.  My impression is that the larger Echos also have much clearer microphone processing, so keeping these as options for more localized spaces like desks and bedside tables makes sense.  Whole room coverage best handled by the standard Echo.  5 out of 5 because of value as a support unit.","April 27, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes folks, I did the unthinkable. I stuck my Echo Dot on the back of the toilet. I've read that most people consider that to be off limits as far as placement goes but it rocks. The bathroom is ideal as the smaller room size is perfectly matched with the Echo Dot sound output. I can shower with an unlimited soundtrack using Pandora, Amazon Music or SiriusXM. The sound quality is impressive for such a small speaker. Being able to adjust the EQ is a nice touch and helps get it just right. Alexa has never failed to respond and remains flawless for almost four months now. The shower steam has had no effect on performance. If it dies in a year or two, at this price, it will have been worth it. Being able to link the Echo Dot and the 4K Fire TV Stick in the bedroom for multi-room sound is neat. An added bonus...I can make an announcement when one of the kids are camped out on the throne watching YouTube and tell them to hurry up.

At first tried to use the headphone jack (on the 3rd Gen Dot) to connect the speaker (but it didn't work). It does however maintain the BT connection much better. However, when connected via blue-tooth it does not work well in an ""everywhere"" speaker group. I have 5 echo devices, and I link them for whole house music. I informed AMAZON, and they have passed it on to their tech group, but no joy yet. So I use this 3rd Gen dot as a stand alone dot in my kitchen, and when not BT connected it does work in my ""everywhere"" group. In the meantime the 2nd gen dot is Bluetooth connected to the Onyx speaker, and does work with ALL of the speaker/dots in my ""everywhere"" group.  So I got the result I wanted (eventually) but performance wise the 2nd generation dot works better than the 3rd gen dot.

However, for a very modest price, we have found the Dot to be a useful, though not essential item, to have in our home.  ""She"" answers questions for us about the weather conditions in our vacation home in Northern New England readily, provides updates on current local weather conditions and road conditions and, of most interest during the past Christmas season, she played seasonal music for us readily upon request.  In fact, we liked the latter feature so well that we signed up for a free 30-day music trial with Amazon Music and will likely continue this feature for the modest monthly cost ($3.99/mo.).  We are amazed at how quickly the Dot can find and play countless numbers of tunes for us and readily provide background music in our home when we entertain or just want to hear certain music ourselves.

I use it every day to listen to news, music, podcasts, etc. I also use it to help me with reminders and other things of that nature. I have mainly given it 4 stars because the tech still needs work. Every once in a while my echo acts goofy and I don't always know why. I think it would be much better if the echo dot announced what's going on whenever it has these issues. For example if there is an update or problem connecting etc. Whenever there is an issue I have to ask it what's going on and I don't always get a response. Probably due to a connection issue. Don't get me wrong, I love the product and I am a huge supporter of it, but I know there are still more improvements that can be made in order to help it to be more user friendly. 4 star rating for me.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was a little worried after reading mixed reviews on this. But I focused on the five star ones and bought this Echo Dot. I have the Echo Plus second gen and I love it so I was a little nervous about getting the Dot. I actually bought four! My mom has an old 80's boombox on her kitchen counter so I wanted to get something smaller to replace it. I opened the Dot I bought for my third floor and set it up today. I can't believe how good it sounds!! One thing that puzzles me about the reviews is how people talk about using the volume buttons on the top. I just say, ""Alexa, volume 4, Or Alexa volume 7"". The sound is great up to volume 8. After that the quality is not as good as the Plus. Still good, but the base isn't as good as the Plus. That being said, the volume is loud and clear and I don't think I'd use 10 anyhow. I can't wait to give my mom this cute little Dot to replace her dinosaur boombox! Great buy, great sound!

We've played all kinds of music through SiriusXM and had no problems at all with the sound quality.  Alexa's voice is very clear and there's no problems understanding what she's saying.  So far, I've used it to set alarms, play music, read us stories, ask general questions, turn on lights.  I really wanted to use the ""Drop-In,"" feature connected to another Dot on a second floor (which is on another account) but found out that I have to have a ""mobile phone number"" which I don't have, so that was very disappointing for me since that was a big reason why I bought it.  The other thing I can't get it to do is remember the ""sound"" I chose for the Alarm.  It always manages to jump back to the Default sound, which isn't terrible, but isn't my choice, either.

""Alexa, please please do what I asked.""""Okay, doing something else completely different.""""Alexa, stop!"" ""Ok google, do this for me.""""Ok, done.""That's about the usual interaction with Alexa. Its voice recognition is BAD, and only correctly understands probably about two-thirds of the time. The other third of the time, it's really bad. If you're lucky, it will decide to define random words or play some random song instead of turning lights off or making a new reminder.  This is for native English speakers who lived in North America for life, probably speaking closest to their basic training data as possible; I can't imagine how it would understand a non-native English speaker or with non-American accents.Do I recommend it? Well, I half recommend it. When it works, it's quite useful, and has pretty good integration, but that's only when it works. You really have to jump through structural hoops and do it in exactly the right structure when asking for things (always always put ""am"" or ""pm"" on you time when setting alarms or reminders, since it likes to set these for the middle of the night), which can be very awkward and unnatural.The design of the companion app keeps changing and still doesn't seem to have a UX expert assigned to it, so it's horrible to navigate through (Google Home app is even worse though, so there's that). I use the reminders feature extensively to help the kids keep track of when to join online school meetings, but I have to go into the app several times a week to fix or create reminders that the voice interface can't do properly.Good: nice access to music and Amazon services (at least with Prime), good integration with wide variety of smart home servicesBad: bad voice recognition and intention understanding, clunky and rigid interface to access some features (you have to phrase it just-right), poor knowledge lookup results (i.e., web search)Comparison to Google Home: I've been using both for years. Echo/Alexa and Google Home are similar on the outside, but have very different (and opposite) strengths and weaknesses. Echo/Alexa are strong on music, Amazon services, and smart-home integration, while Google Home is strong on voice recognition and knowledge search (Google recently killed their good music offering) and ok on Google service integration. When they're on sale they're cheap enough to get both and use them for different things.Bottom line: Alexa raises your blood pressure when you interact with it because Alexa often doesn't understand, in comparison Google Home nearly always understands and does better search but has inferior integrations. Alexa with Google-quality voice recognition would be great, but it's nowhere near that.","October 27, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

But Siri can at least do adjustments to get it close, I’ve tried multiple times to tell Alexa.  So i just gave up on getting it to say it correctly as well as trying to get the voice recognition to operate. No use if it can’t say my name. There was one time it was flashing light green/yellow, i cooled to understand what it meant stated it meant like an incoming call or drop in. It was neither, it was an amazon order being dropped off, and to get it to flashing was to ask Alexa what the status of my order. One time it wouldn’t respond at all just flash blue as if it was peaking but no noises. So i unplugged and plugged it back and it start operating correctly. It’s an okay device, got it for free with Verizon but i wouldn’t spend my money on it just based off those 2 inconveniences.","June 30, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Our son bought us one Echo Dot after I was beset with some health issues, with the thought that he could ""drop in"" on us to see how we're doing, especially if he can't get in touch with us by phone. (We haven't figured out how to let him do that yet).However, after several bouts of pneumonia resulting in multiple hospitalizations, we purchased three more Echo Dots. We now have one each for the bedrooms, the office, and the kitchen. Because my lungs don't work any longer, I use the Dots to speak to my husband in another room, with the door shut, with him wearing headphones. This is the perfect solution to our communication issues.Alexa still has occasional difficulty hearing and responding to me, but so does everyone. She's getting better. And, I know we haven't begun to plumb the system's uses and skills. We pretty much move step by step as a specific need arises.Buying three Echo Does all at once was a bit of a leap of faith, and a big chunk of change for us, but it's well-worth the investment.","December 2, 2019",United States,B07FZ8S74R

The mids and highs are good but struggles on the low end. It has a 3.5mm jack on the back to add an external speaker(s) which I have done.The Dot has a nice weight to it.

I spent many hours looking for tone controls to set bass low and treble high but the '3' doesn't seem to have this capabilty.  I did find a comment somewhere that others are experiencing this, and that both bass and treble can be adjusted by asking alexa to 'set bass to minimum' and 'set treble to maximum' (IIRC these were the commands) but the sound quality for me is still way to blurry and fuzzy.  I would have returned it except it is fine for other members of the family (and grandkids).So, my recco is that if you're experiencing age-related hearing loss, think twice before you buy one...","December 14, 2019",United States,B07FZ8S74R

It has great sound capability, is easy to turn the microphone off on (an obvious necessity when dealing with small kids who, again, want to listen to an endless loop of frozen), and connected to my internet and amazon account easily. The one thing I am disappointed in is how easily it freezes. I will request a song and wait a literal minute, then change my song request and it will play the second song request then cut back to the first song.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought this on black friday, because my 2nd gen dot was getting old and worn out.From what I can tell, they have expanded the frequency response to the detriment of clarity and quality. The bass is more noticable but not in a good way, the lower register of voice also sounds a lot more muffled.Oddly, this lack of clarity also seems to follow through to my bluetooth speaker, very noticable lack of sound quality when compared to the gen 2 dot on the same speaker. It sounds like one of those cheap boomboxes with the ""super bass"" turned on. And, no, there are no eq adjustments made, all are on-center.So, I've set this one aside for non-music purposes and reconnected my gen 2 dot for my music listening.","January 8, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

I bought it because the price was right. I figured that I could return it, if I didn't like it. Well, I'm finding it rather helpful, as I've begun to setup smart devices in my home. Being able to control things from another part of the house is proving to be quite helpful. I  no longer have to go downstairs if I forget to turn off the lights. I'm learning new ways to include Alexa into my everyday life. If anyone is listening, I'm sue that they're quite bored at hearing me talk to myself about my coursework, my job, and gaming.

I have to unplug the device reconnect to fix the issue.Bluetooth Connection Notification: This very ANNOYING device constantly notifies you when it connects to a bluetooth device.  It could be connected to the computer for 10 minutes without use, but as soon as you play some sound, it has to loudly and blaringly notify you of its connection.  It's very annoying.Alexa:  Often times, Alexa responds to a statement/comment I made that did NOT involve Alexa.  I find myself having to argue with Alexa telling her, ""I didn't call you, Alexa - mind yo' business!""Not portable: This thing is not portable... why did I think it was portable?  Why did I think this thing had a built in battery? .... Uggh...Volume: You can sync the volume with your bluetooth device, but the echo notification will always sound at the volume it is independently set on, for example: if you have the volume on low from your computer, and you're listening to it low from the Echo (because it's synced), and you receive a notification sound, that sound is going to be heard at the volume the Echo is independently set on (which is usually on high).Alexa...raise the volume: And she raises the volume slightly... slightly....","February 12, 2021",United States,B07FZ8S74R
"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,Echo Dots go on sale for under $30. They are amazing for that money. The 3.5 mm jack give this smart speaker a distinct advantage over the Google Home Mini because all those old computer amplifier speakers will up the sound quality for pennies.I live in the Google Assistant/Alexia world so I experience the advantages of each.  Alexia has a broader installed base and a slightly different command structure.  Both can be installed across multiple homes in different locations.The Echo Dot has a drop-in function.  Google Home does not.  Drop-in lets you listen in on sounds where the device is.  Some would like that: others would not.This is a tough little speaker.  I have one hung in my unheated garage where temps can reach zero.  It doesn't seen to be affected.  This speaker is perfectly capable of turning on the house lights from outside of the house.  It can turn on the house lights several states away too if you have smart lights installed.  That can freak people out.,"February 13, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"So, I got the two echo dot speakers after a friend gave me their larger echo speaker.  The setup was very easy and Alexa seamlessly integrated with my network, she seems to work well, and I was able to even integrate my Sonos speakers with the network, which is nice.  I now have music in every room in the house.  The problems are:1) There is no full functionality of third-party music services with Alexa.  Have Apple Music and Spotify and Pandora accounts...Apple Music is a paid service, too...but despite having Apple Music set as the default music service in Alexa, she continues to default to Amazon music.  She also refuses to shuffle playlists from any of the music services that allow you to build your own playlists (Spotify and Apple).  You set her to shuffle mode and it just continues to play the playlist in order...and she won’t load the whole playlist...she only plays about the first 15 songs on a loop.  So, while she works okay, there is still a lot missing with full functionality of third party music services.2) Playing music from the Echo speakers requires separate commands for each room, or she’ll just play on all speakers.3) She won’t play the same music on both the Echo speakers and the Sonos speakers...while they are linked in that Alexa will control the Sonos speakers, she will not play the same music on all the speakers.  She requires separate commands for both Sonos and Echo speakers.So, while we are enjoying the benefits of having the speakers, and there are many, I really wish the developers would get to the bottom of these third party music service integration issues.","January 10, 2020",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I ordered two echo dot 3's when Amazon had their ""big sale"".  One set up to wi-if no problem and has worked great since. The second one, I had to try several times to connect, before I was successful. But it did not stay connected and all I could get out of it was a "" I'm having difficulties at this time, please try later"" response. At times it would just start talking without even being prompted.Then it might work for a week or so before it wouldn't do anything. I reached out to customer service via chat. That chat lasted over thirty  minutes only to be "" disconnected "" before problem resolved.  Again I reconnected going thru all the steps.  Week later it didn't stay connected, so I called and talked to a "" electronic specialist "".  That call was over half an hour long. I tried requesting a return shipping label, so I could send it back and get a new replacement since it was a faulty device. I was told that is not an option. I would have to send it back and they would fix it.  I responded that I bought a new item and want a new one as a replacement, not a ""FIXED ITEM ""  He finally agreed to send out a NEW echo dot and I would have to return the original.  A few days later, I received a ""REFURBISHED"" echo dot 3.  When I called to speak to a  supervisor, I was told that it is their policy to send refurbished ones if a new one is not in ""their stock"".  Doesn't matter they have new ones to sell on the website. I told him that I don't except that and it was not what I paid for. And if they are sending out refurbished echos, there must be a huge problem with them. He advised that they test them and to try it out.  So I opened the box.  All that was in the box was the echo dot. No power source .  Again 4th time reaching out to a Tech specialist- supervisor and 45 minutes of phone time. I was told that they only send device out when replacing. And they don't send out any accessories. When was a plug considered an accessory when it is needed to use device.  Again I told him that I bought a new device and it was faulty and I wanted a new device as a replacement.  Not one that has been fixed.  Also I found out that the 90 day warranty did not begin again when the replacement device gets registered. They back date it to the original sell date of first device.  So I only had 40 days left on the warranty.  Also if you go on line , a refurbished echo goes for $29.99, compared to the $ 49.00 , for a new one. Not once did any representative say that I would be refunded the $20.00 difference for the refurbished echo dot. I told him that this is an AMAZON echo dot. It has their name on the product and they should stand behind their name. I also said if I were to buy a tv from a store and took it home and it quit working, they would replace it with a new tv, not a refurbished one. I will never buy another electronic device that AMAZON sells with their name on it. I will tell all my friends and family that they will get screwed if something goes wrong with their product.

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,I bought this product because I wanted to control my TV and other electronics in my home. I will eventually obtain other modules to control lights and heating and cooling.I will have to purchase a new thermostat and other items to make it a smart home.  It works great with prime video. It actually saves money because I have given up other streaming services.I am planning to get more echo dots. And it is fun.  At first it was a little tedious but I got used to registering my devices and pairing devices. I did call for help and found it was a total waste of my time. They did not provide any help.I just dug into it and found it fairly easy. I have more work to do and download more apps. Since I retired from IBM I have all the tine in the world. It helps to have a computer though. Of course you can use a smart phone but the computer makes it much easierStill a lot to learn and hope to help other people and make it easier for them.,"November 22, 2019",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

"Echo Dot (3rd Gen, 2018 release) - Smart speaker with Alexa - Charcoal",5.0 out of 5 stars,"I received mine today as part of the promo $.99 Echo Dot with Amazon music subscription. I thought great, here’s an affordable easily portable little speaker. I intended to use this as a Bluetooth speaker on camping trips and nothing else. First off, you can’t even pair your phone to the speaker without having the Alexa app. Second problem: you cannot pair your phone to the speaker if you do not have Wi-Fi. I do not have WiFi where I live. Third problem: the minute you unplug it from the power source it turns off - there is no power on and off button.I have no desire to use it for Alexa. I don’t use any of the assistant apps like Alexa - why? Well. Amazon records you. Don’t believe me? Look it up. I’ve heard horror stories of Alexa recording private conversations and then somehow sending them out into the public. You can go online to view all of the recordings your device has on you. You can individually delete recordings as you choose but you cannot stop Amazon from recording you. It’s supposed to only record you when you use the word Alexa but somehow sometimes it records more even when you don’t want to.So. I will be sending mine back. It’s my fault for not reading more about the functions of this device and assuming I could trick it somehow to be used the way I want. I’m giving 3 stars just because I can’t say wether it works the way it’s intended to or not so I don’t want to leave just 1 Star but I also can’t give it 5.","June 15, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

It's infinitely better than Siri and in my opinion, a little better than the google products I've encountered.The mics seems to pick up sound a little better than previous generations. It's certainly better looking. Softer edges and the fabric outside are a much better aesthetic. I also can't believe how easy the setup was. It was basically plug in play. Out of the box, it was ready to go in my Amazon account.The biggest difference for me, the selling point of the upgrade is the sound on this one is worlds better. It's not even close.  I'm not one for upgrading tech often but the sound upgrade on this is INSANE. One thing to note, is that it goes from a micro-usb cable to a more proprietary one if that matters to you.","November 4, 2020",United States,B07FZ8S74R

I'm not going to talk about all her qualities because everyone else has that covered.Here's my problem. I use this one mainly as an alarm clock and sleep noise machine. Alexa used to work flawlessly for this, but she has become increasingly annoying with attempts to upgrade my services. The sound randomly shuts off in the middle of the night. So first problem is that I have to speak out loud, waking my husband, to get her going again. THEN to make matters so much worse, she launches into a sales pitch. Saying ""stop"" doesn't work. She just keep pitching that upgrade. Sometimes she promises to only make that offer to you one more time, but she lies like a cheap rug. So, in the middle of the night, there I am arguing with Alexa. by the time she starts making ocean sounds again, I'm angry and can't get back to sleep. I guess I'll have to buy an actual sound machine and have two things on my nightstand instead of one. UGH!","August 10, 2021",United States 🇺🇸,B07FZ8S74R

If I ask it to play an artist, I want it to play it until there are no more tunes to play by that artist or until I ask it to change to another artist or stop. When you move from one place to another you have to reset up Alexa. That is annoying but not too difficult to do.

My husband has an alarm set and we hear a daily ""flash briefing"" that includes weather, bible scripture of the day, a Positivity message,  and morning News brief.  Alexa and I start our day off with a morning prayer and end the day with evening prayer.  Very cool!  We've extended the device in other parts of the house and enjoy playing Jazz, Earth Wind & Fire, or whatever while doing our Saturday chores...

If we start talking anything serious like finances, I cut the mic on the dot.I am very impressed with the sound quality. It’s not as good as my HomePod, but it’s miles ahead of my iPhone and and good enough for normal use. For Apple Music, the HomePod is king simply because the dot can’t compare due to its size.

I'm going to confess to being a bit leery; I've heard so many cautionary tales touching on invasion of privacy of Alexa owners.

HOWEVER:  There is, for me, an undeniable pleasure in having such ready access to, basically, any and all information one might conceivably care to have.  Plus, it's clear Alexa wants to do more for us :).  She often asks us if we'd like to know about all the functions she can perform ... we have the sense she's champing at the bit to organize our lives.  So ... bottom line is that living with Alexa, for me, is how I imagine it might be to live with a vital, engaged, and know-it-all elderly aunt.

They paired in under a minute as well.I'm deaf in my left ear, so wearing both buds can be superfluous, but these actually give off enough bass to give me the sensation of ""hearing"" on my deaf side. For those who dont understand, because I only went deaf in that ear 2 years ago, it helps u feel less ""imbalanced"", so it's a HUGE plus for me with my vertigo. You can still tell there's some sort of sound happening.The only downside I can see is that, when I went to test them, they seemed a bit larger than my old ones. However, I haven't worn my old ones in a very long time, as I've been going to the gym with a friend and enjoying her company instead, so I'm hoping my ears just have to adapt to them.Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase and hope you are too if you order these! :)Ps- the packaging they came in was also very nice. They're encased in the black foam you'd typically see in gun cases, or cases for musical instruments and such, not some cheap plastic. Not sure if this matters, but it makes me feel like the company is just putting a little extra thought into their customer's experience!","September 24, 2022",United States,B09LCVHCVX

I came across these yobola T9 Wireless Earbuds and they were the perfect fit for me. Not only is the pink color so pretty but they also were so easy to pair up and the sound quality was excellent. The shape of the earbuds fit just right in my ear to where they stay secure in my ears without hurting them.

But these do not fit my ears at all and are constantly falling out.

All the books are through different production groups and the ticking is ALWAYS there. That’s why I feel it might be the earbuds. Battery life is great. The magnet that holds them in the case is nice and strong. Just wish the battery was displayed on the front so I knew when to charge.

My first instinct was to grab another box with Apple product but Amazon played a decent trick on me - they displayed other headphones that ""look like"" AirPods but cost small fraction of what Apple is asking. Is there any catch? Well, after reading reviews of YOBOLA wireless headphones I was convinced that it is more than worth to give them a try especially that price was so much more palatable than Apple's AirPods. There is not much point writing long review about headphones so I will be brief. After comparing AirPods (2nd generation) to Yobola, the latter one is a clear winner. Why?1. Sounds quality - Yobola sounds better especially in the lower range - i.e. much better bass2. Features - Yobola lets you adjust volume just by touch - something that Airpods cannot do. Other than that both Apple and Yobola are quite similar. BTW integration with an iPhone is flawless with both pairs of headphones3. Price -  you can get 5 Yobola headphones for the price of one Apple productIn summary I am giving YOBOLA 5 stars. Definitely worth a try","September 18, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,B09LCVHCVX

I'm glad that I did order them however because for the price I paid for these they're amazing, I'll even say that these have better sound quality than a more expensive pair I have bought in the past. My only gripe about these is that the Bluetooth signal is kind of weak, I'm not sure if that is common with Wireless earbuds but if I put my phone in my back pocket and have my earbuds in sometimes the signal interrupts in one earbud or the other if I twist my body just right so I try to keep my phone in a front pocket if I can help it and it works just fine. It also works just fine if I have my phone laying nearby while I'm working out.

I’m at the gym” so for a quick reply, they’re fine. The sound quality of the music is really good and the battery life seems good too!

I wanted something I could carry around the city and not fear the financial pain of losing one of the ear buds. These are well priced ($20 -  not worth more than that). The sound quality for music is perfectly fine - to the people complaining about the sound quality - go buy the $150 - $250 Apple Airpods or Samsung pods, and chill, these are not meant to replace those.Sound quality for music: 7/10 (a lot of bass, and sounds very full; somewhat cancels noise)Sound quality for talk: 8/10 (excellent quality - my 64 year old mom could hear me perfectly and I could hear her quite well also)Range: Decent, as people have been saying, you can walk several feet away and quality will be fine.CONSI expect the battery life to be sub par (for long trips I would bring along my airpods). I'm sure these won't last anywhere near 12 or 24 hours.THESE DO NOT PAIR WITH MACBOOK PRO M1 LAPTOPS.For me, this was the biggest letdown.

I have never tried this type of bud before, the sit in the ear style, and I do think I will try it once more as I like the idea of how they work (and sometimes hate the silicone/rubber/'whatever they are made from' tips poking me), but these were just a little too big for my ears and thus the sound level wasn't as I had hoped.I know I am not going to get booming sound out of this style of earbud, but I only want these for watching shows on my tablet and was cranking the volume all the way up and it sounded like it was only reaching about a 25% level. Again, I think that is on me and my small ears and not (necessarily) the product and I could in time find that none of this style of earbud will work for my intentions. I am afterall currently using a nice ""in ear"" style now (just wanted to try this type).I guess I should have tried with my phone and some music to see if I could get a different result, but again, my primary reason for these are for tablet viewing.Worth a shot for the price alone, for sure, especially if your ear hole is bigger than my ear hole.

They have about 90% of the features of Airpods at an unbelievable price.  I was pleasantly surprised with how nice the build quality was, given how inexpensive these are.  The design is nice and sleek.I bought these to replace my broken Airpods and I've noticed only a couple of minor differences that aren't an issue for me personally:1.  The case does not pair to your phone so you cannot tell exactly how much battery life is left in your case.  The case has an indicator light that flashes when it is below 10% and needs charging.2.  You need to accept phone calls from your earbuds in order for the call to be taken on your earbuds.  If you answer a call on your phone screen, the call will be taken on your phone as well.3.  There are no sensors on the earbuds that automatically start/stop music when your remove/put in the earbuds from your ears.  You need to start/stop manually using the earbud tap functions (I prefer this personally)4.  The tap functions are not programmable like with the Airpods, but all the basic functions you'd expect and need are already there.Overall, these are excellent earbuds for the price.  They're such great value that I bought multiple so I could have one in my office, car, and home.","July 20, 2022",United States,B09LCVHCVX

I had been using the mpow t3 for a while now and they never felt good.  I think in ears never really felt good to me.  However, these style of ear buds are the most comfortable that aren't over the ear cans.  They don't sound as good as in ear but that's ok.  The mic quality is trash but usable I guess.  One bug I noticed is that the volume is off by one click.  So it's zero when it should be 1 volume and 1 when it should be 2 so on so forth.  All my other headphones don't have this issue.","July 12, 2022",United States,B09LCVHCVX

All the way around they give you plenty of presence at the mids and highs.  They do pick up the lows, but I still desire a little more push from them in that way.

They wanted to give me a $15 Amazon gift card. I informed them this was not necessary as the product was not defective, it just didn’t fit my ears. I was impressed they reached out and wanted to give me a gift, but, then I got an email asking me to delete my review. This is a disgusting manipulative tactic. The headphones are more than $15 and asking me to delete my review to skew the overall rating is so grimy. Be aware, and if I were you, don’t support this business.","April 21, 2022",United States 🇺🇸,B09LCVHCVX

Better then my last pair! Battery life is very long (I lose count of the hours) Of course I gave 3 star for noise cancelation because these types of headphones dont really do that.

But all in all I dont regret them!UPDATE September 19 2022- the headphones are starting to not fully charge. Very annoying and a HASSLE. I keep them and the pod clean, no build up. This has been happening for about 3 weeks. Guess they dont have longevity. Only charge when it dies. I now wish I spent the money on the last I bought from a different brand. Atleast they lasted about a year!!! Changed it to 2 stars. They were nice while it lasted. Only more down hill from here.

They fit well and stayed in throughout a variety of activities.  The touch sensor was the only initial complaint as it didn't seem to always respond on a first touch.  However, I've only had this product for a few months and the volume capability of the ear buds began to fade.  It started with the left ear bud being a lot quieter than the other and as I liked to have the option to run one ear bud at a time if desired but even on the highest volume setting and trying all potential software settings, it is barely audible with any type of ambient noise.  Than 2 weeks ago the right ear bud had the same issue.  I have volume turned all the way up and these ear buds just no longer perform.  Something has clearly gone wrong with them and rendered them useless.  I tried to use them on a plane ride the other day and I couldn't hear anything over the ambient noise of the plan in flight.

I decided to give these a shot based on the positive reviews and the low price. After using them for a few weeks, I'm really happy with them and so far am glad I didn't spend way more. They fit in my ears pretty well (one side doesn't fit quite as well as the other, but it does stay in for the most part...not sure I'd be comfortable running or doing other intense activities with these in, though). The battery life seems awesome, as I will sometimes listen to these for several hours a day and don't charge the case more than maybe once a week, and I have yet to run the battery down to the point where they're unusable.

Dafür ist der Sitz nicht gegeben aber das ist auch nicht das hauptsächliche Aufgabengebiet.Für den Preis und den gestellten Anforderungen sind die Kopfhörer prima.Ich benutze sie viel um Musik zu hören im Büro oder um Telefonate abzuwickeln. Zwischenzeitlich auch beim Kunden in Server Umgebung.Die Sprachqualität wurde von meinem gegenüber nicht groß bemängelt. Klar ist aber auch das diese nicht dem entspricht das ein richtiges Headset teils rausholen kann. Wind Geräusche werden rudimentär heraus gerechnet.Die Akku Laufzeit bei täglich circa 4h aktiver Nutzung ist sehr gut. Inklusive dem Ladecase komme ich damit gut 5 Tage aus.Alles in allem bin ich sehr zufrieden, eine funktionierende App wäre noch nice, diese fehlt komplett. Ebenso ist die Handhabung zur Kopplung bei mehreren Endgeräten sehr müßig. Hierfür darf keine BT Verbindung bestehen mit einem gekoppelten Gerät.Die tast Haptik ist super und reagiert konsequent benötigt jedoch am Anfang etwas Hirnschmalz um sich diese zu merken.Ich hoffe ich konnte helfen, bis bald.","October 13, 2022",Germany,B09LCVHCVX

They're small enough to almost pass off as a top brand and the charge hold is more than enough for me.I wouldn't say they are noise cancelling, but I've worn them on a plane, train, and in the gym with no issues. If you're on the lookout for some cheap headphones that do the job, these are the ones.","October 1, 2022",United Kingdom,B09LCVHCVX

"Wireless Earbuds, yobola Bluetoth Earbuds, IPX5 Waterproof Wireless Headphones Touch Control, Bluetoth Headphones 5.1 Built-in Microphone, 25 Hrs with USB-C Charging with Running/Fitness",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Allora, le cuffie funzionano molto bene. E' la prima volta che acquisto cuffie senza fili e perciò non mi aspettavo nulla di particolare. Il suono non è ottimale con la musica, ma parla una persona che con la musica ci lavora, quindi il mio giudizio è molto molto critico. Per chi come me vuole sentire meglio i bassi (perché con queste cuffie spariscono) può andare su Spotify ad impostazioni > equalizzatore. E li può ridimensionare il suono a suo piacimento. Quindi problema risolto. Per quanto riguarda il volume invece, sì, effettivamente è un po' basso ma io ero abituata ad un altro tipo di cuffie. Ad ogni modo il problema è risolvibile anche in quel caso perché ad alcuni telefoni si può eliminare l'audio predefinito tramite le impostazioni sviluppatore (se cercate tutorial su internet è davvero molto facile), per chi invece come me ha un Redmi Note, la questione si complica perché in alcuni telefoni Xiaomi non c'è questa opzione. Ho risolto in ogni caso (perché non mi do pace se le cose non sono come le voglio io) scaricando un booster che aumenta di un po' il volume delle cuffie.La batteria dura. Va benissimo. Io le uso tutti i giorni per la musica o chiamate. E devo dire che da quando le ho comprate si sono scaricate solo la prima volta (con la batteria di quando le ho tirate fuori per la prima volta, per intenderci, quindi non so quanto fossero state caricate). Per quanto mi riguarda sono abbastanza soddisfatta, nonostante queste accortezze, sarà che è il mio primo acquisto di questo tipo. Le ho comprate per fino a mia madre e ne è contentissima anche lei. Unica grossa pecca che credo non si possa risolvere: quando la batteria sta per esaurirsi, ti avvisa con un segnale sonoro che le cuffie stanno per spegnersi (quando arriva a 10%). Questo suono è ESTREMAMENTE alto, rispetto a tutto il resto e non capisco per quale motivo. Inoltre si ripete dopo un po' di tempo. Quindi ora che ho anche aumentato il volume cerco di ovviare a questo problema, controllando sempre lo stato batteria e cercando di non farla arrivare al 10%.","June 12, 2022",Italy,B09LCVHCVX

"Wireless Earbuds, yobola Bluetoth Earbuds, IPX5 Waterproof Wireless Headphones Touch Control, Bluetoth Headphones 5.1 Built-in Microphone, 25 Hrs with USB-C Charging with Running/Fitness",1.0 out of 5 stars,"Fazit: Gute Kopfhörer für kleines GeldHinweis: Der Hersteller hat um Rezension gebeten und verspricht dafür einen Gutschein. Er hat aber keine Vorgabe zur Wertung gemacht (ob er‘s tut und täte, insbesondere bei schlechter Wertung, sei mal dahingestellt). Ich finde die Kopfhörer gut, bin aber im Allgemeinen zu faul, etwas zu schreiben, hier wurde ich motiviert. 😉Auf der Suche nach kabellosen Kopfhörern für meine Mutter, die gern auf dem iPad mal ein Video oder ein bisschen Musik hört, die meinen Vater weniger interessieren, hab ich dieses Paar ausgewählt.Voraussetzungen:Es sollten nicht die teuren Dinger sein…Wichtig war mir, dass das iPad merkt, wenn der Kopfhörer im Case gelandet ist und automatisch die Wiedergabe stoppt und dann beim weiteren Wiedergabestart auf die Lautsprecher umschaltet (das klappte leider nicht bei den Soundpeats, die ich ansonsten super fand, aber die muss man halt am Kopfhörer ausschalten - kann man mal vergessen oder man tippt zu viel und Zack, sagt das iPad auf einmal nichts mehr, weil es nicht vorhandene Kopfhörer versorgt… da führt ggf. zu Verwirrung, wollte ich nicht). Die Hörer werden beim nächsten Auspacken trotzdem wieder automatisch gekoppelt und es kann ohne Umweg über das Menü weitergehen.Außerdem sollte es nicht aus Versehen zum Aktivieren des Sprachassistenten kommen. Hier braucht es dreimal Tippen. Das passt also für mich auch.Ansonsten:Die Verpackung, in der Kopfhörer und Case zusammen mit Kabel und Bedienungsanleitung ankommen, ist nett, die Kopfhörer sind außerhalb des Ladekästchens in anthrazitfarbenem Schaumstoff. Quadratisches, schlichtes Kästchen, das so gut schließt, dass man es nur für Dinge weiterverwenden sollte, an die man nicht oft dran muss. 😉Super ist die mehrsprachige Bedienungsanleitung. Kurzes Ladekabel (USB) ist dabei, Case war teilgeladen, Kopfhörer brauchten zum Aufladen einen Moment (geht aber schnell - zum Ausprobieren sowieso).Ich benötige keine App (bekomme aber auch keine, ggf. muss man Einstellungen am Synthesizer des Telefons vornehmen). Ein helles Ding-Dong beim Koppeln - nicht zu laut (ist bei anderen z.T. unangenehm), keine Stimme, die irgendwas auf Chinesisch oder Englisch sagt oder gar „brüllt“.Die Kopfhörer sind etwas gedrungener als die AirPods (zum Vergleich rechts im Bild). Ansonsten ist die Größe recht ähnlich. Die Kopfhörer selbst sind nicht ganz glatt, sondern in einer leicht rauen Oberfläche (wie dickes Papier anmutend) gefertigt, nur der Teil, der am Ohr direkt anliegt ist ganz glatt. Ich persönlich mag eine glatte Oberfläche eigentlich lieber, stören tut die andere nicht, scheint auch kein Schmutzfänger zu sein. Ich habe sehr kleine Ohren (bzw. Eingänge zum Hörkanal) und kann die Kopfhörer minimal schlechter im Ohr vertragen als die weniger dicke Version von Apple, aber sie sind trotzdem noch ok. Meine Mutter meinte, dass sie die Dinger manchmal regelrecht vergisst, weil sie so leicht und gut sitzen.Das Case ist deutlich leichter und fühlt sich (dadurch?) dünner und weniger wertig an als das der AirPods - ich würde es nicht in der Tasche unter einer Konservendose landen sehen wollen, aber ansonsten bedeutet das einfach auch weniger Geschleppe, was ich nicht verkehrt finde… Oberfläche ebenfalls leicht rau. Die magnetische Halterung der Hörer ist nicht zu stark und nicht zu schwach, aufladen klappt anstandslos.Der Sound ist prima. Keine Wunder erwarten, aber für Pop und TV völlig ok. Bass und Höhen ausgewogen. Lautstärke hab ich nicht ausreizen können, spiele auf niedriger Lautstärke ohne Probleme (wobei ich gut höre). Man kann die Hörer auch einzeln benutzen.Die Bedienung: Wo mir bei Apple immer noch ein paar Befehle fehlen, hier ist alles dabei. Einmal tippen, lang halten, zwei- bzw. dreimal Tippen. Das sind potentiell acht Befehle , da geht viel, wenn auch nicht alles einfach oder perfekt. Wenn man lange Haare hat und in der Nähe des Ohres wischt, kann das schon mal Effekte zeitigen, die nicht gewünscht sind, das sollte man bedenken.Telefonieren funktioniert. Ich höre den Gesprächspartner sehr gut, auf der anderen Seite komme ich etwas leiser als direkt am Telefon an (hängt sicher z.T. damit zusammen, wie gut die Mikros zum Mund ausgerichtet sind), etwas Hall, insgesamt aber völlig ok (nur in ruhiger Umgebung getestet).Ich liebe meine AirPods und werde wohl nicht wechseln... Wenn man bei diesen Kopfhörern mit einem Tipp keine Aktion auslösen würde, wäre mir das lieber. Diese Alternative von yobola ist aber sooo viel günstiger, dass ich sie vom Preis-Leistungsverhältnis nur empfehlen kann.","March 10, 2022",Germany 🇩🇪,B09LCVHCVX

They are a similar shape to the Apple ones my sons have but I didn't want to pay as much. For less than a quarter of the price they do the job well.They were not bought for noise cancelling but I prefer to be able to hear some around me when I'm outside so I'm aware of my surroundings to keep me safe. Other reviews mention sound level being too quiet but a quick search on YouTube will show how to put your phone in developer mode as it's the phone that sets the maximum volume limit. I've no issues with the bass and treble the earbuds provide. They retain their charge well too.All things summed up, I'd recommend these earbuds as an alternative to more expensive ones.

Das betone ich, weil dieses selbst in der billigsten Variante acht Euro kostet. Zieht man dies von dem Kaufpreis ab, so hat man einen guten in Ear Kopfhörer für 21 €. Zu dem Gerät selbst: ich bin mit diesem Gerät nun in den Urlaub gefahren und habe – wie es sich gehört – das Ladekabel vergessen. Trotzdem konnte ich ohne klangverlust weit über 12 Stunden Videos und Musik hören ohne dass das Gerät entladen war. In der Klangqualität oder Tonqualität habe ich ein Punkt abgezogen, da bei der Nutzung sich die Lautstärke reduziert hat gegenüber dem hören über das Musik beziehungsweise Stream Gerät. Die lange Laufzeit ist es sehr gut.  Die Kopfhörer halten sich stabil im Ohr und fallen. Ichs beim ersten berühren aus dem Ohr. Ebenfalls gut ist die Spielerei des akustischen Signals; sobald man den Kopfhörer in seine passende Form steckt, erhält man einen Signalton, das dieser richtig drinnen ist. Ein Problem stellt das Ladekabel dar. Es hat eine eigene Größe und testet man oft das falsche Ladesteckteil, um das richtige Ladekabel dann einzustecken. Dies wird dazu führen, dass die Ladebuchse ausgeleiert wird.Da man jedoch für Markenprodukte von in Ear Kopfhörer gut 200 € investiert, hat man mit diesem Gerät ein sehr gutes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis.","August 21, 2022",Germany,B09LCVHCVX

I use them everyday for at least an hour and I haven’t charged the case yet (bought them early June 2022).The sound quality isn’t great, not a huge amount of bass but the mids/treble are very clear. However they’re fine to use for your commute, casual music/podcast listening etc. The volume is fine, not quiet which I thought they might be. I wouldn’t say they’re noise cancelling but I wasn’t expecting them to be as they’re not over the ear cans with padding to isolate the noise.They are small and light so I’ve flung one across the room by accident when taking a jumper off because I forgot I had them in so I can imagine they’re easy to lose (but that’s not a fault of the manufacturer) however I have constant porridge brain and I’ve not lost them yet!!They pair to your phone/ipad/laptop as soon as you take them out of the charger pouch (post setup) and doesn’t call for a mad set up time.Overall VERY happy with my earphones, would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to dip their toe in the wireless headphone pool!","July 1, 2022",United Kingdom,B09LCVHCVX

Einstellungen).Sobald die Verbindung aufgebaut wurde, hört man einen kurzen Signalton in den Kopfhörern und dann kann man schon die Musik hören/starten.Sobald man die Kopfhörer wieder ins Case zurück gibt, wird die Verbindung zum Handy getrennt und sie werden neu geladen. Dazu blinkt eine Leuchte auf dem Case. Beim Einsetzen in das Case muss man aber darauf achten, welche der rechte und welcher der linke Kopfhörer ist (ist aber gut erkennbar beschriftet auf den Kopfhörern und im Case).Zur Akkuleistung von den Kopfhörern kann ich noch relativ wenig sagen. Ich habe das Case erst zweimal aufgeladen (das erste mal war gleich nach Erhalt), aber die Kopfhörer waren noch nie komplett leer.Zum Laden des Cases kann jedes USB-C-Ladekabel verwendet werden (Es ist aber auch eines beim Produkt dabei). Wenn das Case komplett geladen ist, leuchtet ein grünes Licht auf.Die Tonqualität ist wirklich gut. Man hat durchgehend eine gleichbleibende Qualität und Lautstärke.Telefonate habe ich mit den Kopfhörern noch nicht getestet.Man kann auch nur einen der Kopfhörer aus dem Case nehmen und nur diesen mit dem Smartphone koppeln.Fazit: Klare Kaufempfehlung für diesen Preis (ca. € 25,-) und geeignet fürs Joggen.","July 22, 2022",Germany 🇩🇪,B09LCVHCVX

Once paired for the first time, the buds connect to my phone as soon as they're out of their charging case and disconnect again once they're put back without any intervention. The only negative aspect I found with these are a lack of clarity on the high frequencies and an overemphasis on the bass which give them a pretty unbalanced sound. This can be remedied somewhat by using third party eq apps but it's not a fantastic solution.

Je ne m’attendais pas non plus à une équivalence avec ces écouteurs mais c’est plutôt une bonne surprise au vu du prix : franchement les matériaux utilisés sont plutôt de bonne facture (plastique) , le boîtier et les écouteurs sont bien finis. Le packaging ressemble de toutes façons à la marque à la pomme ce qui est loin de décevoir. Très simple de pris en main,  la connexion avec le téléphone est immédiate et se fait sans problème . La qualité du son n’est pas transcendante mais ça reste acceptable. Avec la promo il faut se dire que ça coûte 3 à 4 x moins cher que les originaux… le confort dans les oreilles est très bon , pas de gêne. Globalement très satisfait , ça reste des écouteurs d’un rapport qualité prix plus qu’intéressant,  je n’ai pas encore testé la tenue de la charge , à voir… a vérifier aussi les quelques déconnexion Bluetooth constatées (problème de l’application ou du réseau ), pas très méchant .","July 2, 2022",France,B09LCVHCVX

Es geht hier um die Verbindungsstabilität der Bluetooth Verbindung. Da der Sony Kopfhörer wunderbar läuft, auch wenn zwischen dem Kopfhörer und dem Smartphone ca 5-10 Meter inkl. Sichttrennung liegt,ist es bei diesem Kopfhörer alles andere als schön. Schon alleine das Handy in der hinteren Hosentasche sorgt dafür, daß der Ton von einem der beiden Hörer öfter abreisst( in der Regel die Seite, die bei einer Kopfbewegung dann weiter entfernt ist. Ich habe das Gefühl, das hier ein schlechte Bluetooth Schnittstelle verbaut wurde. Wenn die Verbindung stabil ist, dann ist es ein Top Produkt für diesen Preis, aber hier ist Bluetooth nicht gleich Bluetooth.Was mich stutzig macht, das kaum jemand dieses Problem beschreibt, vielleicht hab ich aber auch nur einen Defekt oder ein Montagsprodukt.Für diesen Preis mach ich aber kein Fass auf, ich kann damit Leben :)","July 16, 2022",Germany,B09LCVHCVX

"Wireless Earbuds, yobola Bluetoth Earbuds, IPX5 Waterproof Wireless Headphones Touch Control, Bluetoth Headphones 5.1 Built-in Microphone, 25 Hrs with USB-C Charging with Running/Fitness",4.0 out of 5 stars,I bought these ear buds for running mainly and I’ve found they do the job well enough for the price I paid. They have only fallen out once during use and that was my main concern before I purchased them so I’m happy about that. I haven’t quite got to grips with the controls on the side. Can’t seem to get them to do anything but switch off when I touch them. This also makes it tricky if you have to push them back in/reposition them as you end up switching off whatever is playing. But I’ll figure that out. I like the little charging box. I haven’t had to recharge them yet although I’ve used them several times so that’s really good. The sound quality is good listening to music or while on the phone but I was told I sounded echoey from the other end by one person.  That may happen with other brands though perhaps.All in all I’m very happy with my purchase.,"June 22, 2022",United Kingdom,B09LCVHCVX

Und der Akku der Kopfhörer scheint ewig zu halten. Am Handy wird angezeigt, wie hoch der Akkustand ist. Einen Sturz aus gut drei Metern haben sie auch schon überstanden (die Treppe runter auf Fließenboden).Der Sound ist gut. Umgebungstöne werden sehr gut gemindert bzw blockiert.

Adaptable a todo tipo de orejas, las normativas y las no normativas. Calidad de sonido más allá de lo esperado, o quizá yo me dejo sorprender al ser un asiduo a los auriculares de cable a 3 euros. Aísla bien el sonido exterior y muy buenos graves consiguiendo algo muy envolvente, tanto como para abstraerse de vecinos reggaetoneros y bachateros ruidosos.Se manipula digitalmente a la perfección aunque debes de ser algo sensible a los cliqueos dactilares para no pausar la música cuando quieres cambiar de canción porque te aburre la que estás escuchando (un tic pausa, dos tics pasas de canción, tic pulsado bajas o aumentas el volumen dependiendo del auricular y su direccionalidad, el izquierdo baja y el derecho sube, tres tics te pasa con el asistente de Google, por si eres un lobo solitario y necesitas escuchar la voz de una mujer que te responde a lo que preguntas sin andarse por las ramas).En síntesis, una grata compra que recomiendo para todos aquellos que no deseen gastarse 1/4 de sueldo en unos buenos auriculares.","May 5, 2022",Spain,B09LCVHCVX

I am a total podhead (listen to a lot of podcasts) so I bought these as a low commitment practice run for AirPods to see if I’d lose or forget to charge them… #adhdproblems. I definitely expected them to be a bit crap at £20 but they have surpassed all expectations - I’m not even going to bother getting the Apple version. Battery life is great, they last about a week and I use them every day. They connect to my phone easily and automatically as soon as I take them out of the case - I’ve also connected to my laptop without any issues. The touch command is pretty good - contrastingly much better than my boyfriend’s £300 Samsung earbuds which he has to dramatically smack himself round the head to pause. I have frustratingly small ear holes but they fit well, maybe slightly less comfortably than their Apple counterparts, but not everyone has ridiculously tiny ears.

Diese Annahme hat sich absolut bestätigt. Klein, handlich, praktisch.Bei so kleinen Dingen, wie diese kleinen Kopfhörer, hat man häufig die Angewohnheit, sie irgendwo liegen zu lassen... Irgendwie ist das hier nicht der Fall. Der Behälter für die Kopfhörer ist total praktisch. Sie werden dort magnetisch gehalten und gleichzeitig geladen. Irgendwann muss dann den Behälter an selbst irgendwann mal laden, aber gefühlt nur 2x im Monat, je nach Nutzungshäufigkeit.Es gibt kein nerviges Kabelwirrwarr und auch der Klang ist überraschend gut. Mittels Tippen auf die Außenseite der Kopfhörer kann man seinen Film oder die Musik pausieren oder starten. Auch telefonieren funktioniert super und man selbst ist für den Anrufer gut verständlich. Ich hab regelmäßig auch nur 1 Kopfhörer drin, und auch das ist völlig problemlos. Die Reichweite zum Handy beträgt ca. 10m, dann wirds aber auch schon abgehackt. Aber über 7-8m sollte eine Klangübertragung problemlos funktionieren.Ich habe wirklich rein gar nichts zu beanstanden, der Preis ist super, die Kopfhörer sind super, die Lieferung war wie immer super.

Der Ton ist flach, der Tragekomfort ist dürftig - es wirkt alles billig. Die Earbuds sind in Verpackung und Design sehr nah an den AirPods (2. Generation) angelehnt, fast schon unverschämt kopiert.Warum trotzdem vier Sterne?Die Kopfhörer sind ultra leicht, liegen im Bett sehr gut an (gegenüber AirPods Pro drückt hier im Liegen nichts). Der Ton ist für Hörbücher/Podcasts/Sprachinhalte sehr geeignet. Die Multitouch Funktionen sind voreingestellt und in der Anleitung beschrieben, sogar +/- der Lautstärke sind möglich und weitere Funktionen (das könnte Apple so ähnlich gestalten). Das Halten der Verbindung ist 1-2 Räume entfernt möglich, schnell an seine Grenzen kommt man. Die Dauer kann ich wenig einschätzen, da sie nur zum Schlafengehen vorgesehen sind.Es sind Budget Kopfhörer die für 25,- EUR völlig zweckdienlich sind und abgesehen von der Optik nicht in der gleichen Liga spielen wie die 100-200 EUR teureren Produkte.Kleiner Hinweis: Nach dem Entfernen aus den Ohren läuft der Ton weiter, keine automatische Ausschaltung.","May 21, 2022",Germany,B09LCVHCVX

Der Ton ist für den Preis wirklich gut. Hier unterscheidet sich natürlich, je nachdem wie man die Kopfhörer trägt, die Tonqualität. Drücke ich sie weiter rein, habe ich natürlich mehr Bass, als würde ich sie nur locker tragen.Der Komfort ist leider das was mich am meisten stört.Die Kopfhörer drücken gegen meine Ohrmuschel, weshalb ich beim tragen leichte Schmerzen spüre. Das Problem hatte ich beim originalen Apple Produkt nicht. Wenn ich sie eher schräg in den Gehörgang trage, ist es für mich angenehmer als ein loses tragen. Immer noch nicht perfekt aber in Ordnung.Mit der Bedienung bin ich noch nicht ganz warm geworden. Man kommt schnell beim richten des Buds an das Tastenfeld, weshalb ich öfters die Musik pausiere. Das Skippen eines Songs funktioniert manchmal schlecht, weshalb ich dann nur pausiere oder zwei Lieder auf einmal skippe. Liegt aber vermutlich an meiner Bedienung und hat eher nichts mit dem Produkt zu tun.Das Ladecase hält wirklich sehr lange und musste von mir bisher noch nicht geladen werden.  Alles in einem finde ich, dass die Kopfhörer für den Preis sehr gut sind. Tragekomfort ist leider wirklich nicht das Gelbe vom Ei aber noch erträglich für mich. :)Update 13.04.2022: die Kopfhörer geben ab und an ein Rauschen, wie bei nem Wackelkontakt ab.","March 31, 2022",Germany 🇩🇪,B09LCVHCVX

They randomly disconnect every time you use them, multiple times...or they connect by them selves the moment you take them out of casing...Connecting them to laptop and then going out for a break and connecting them to your phone means you spend 15min trying to sodding connect them to your phone. And my favourite - exercising, sudden movements like going from squat to standing up - makes them disconnect. Also almost every time you take them out of casing my Spotify has weird bug and starts playing music by itself(although the app is closed). The audio is ok but not great, and mic qualityis terrible - if you're talking on the phone they'll hear noises and other people more loudly than you.

Sia per me che ricevo la telefonata (o ascoltando musica, video, ecc) che per chi ascolta la mia voce dall'altra parte (ho fatto la prova io stessa ascoltando dall'altro dispositivo) la qualità dell'audio è ottima, perfetta! Per le orecchie più raffinate forse mancano un po' i bassi, ma dipende sempre dall'uso che uno pretende di farne.La DIMENSIONE degli auricolari è identica a quelli con il filo che già possedevo. Sono piccoli nella parte tonda e il corpo allungato rimane ben saldo, anche quando faccio ginnastica.Ho aspettato a fare la recensione qualche giorno, posso dire che anche la PROVA BATTERIA ha superato le aspettative: le cuffie sono arrivate 10 giorni fa, ho messo a caricare la prima notte la custodia, utilizzato le cuffie in diversi momenti delle giornate, lavoro, ufficio sport, riponendole nella custodia più volte, permettendo la ricarica. Oggi ho collegato nuovamente la custodia alla presa e direi che il risultato è più che soddisfacente.La CUSTODIA funziona da powerbank per gli auricolari, ha una lucina bianca che lampeggia quando si attacca per la ricarica; al momento della completa ricarica la luce diventa fissa. Quando si stacca la lucina rimane verde e si spenge dopo pochi secondi, riaccendendosi ogni volta che si ripongono gli auricolari al loro posto (e contemporaneamente si ricaricano), a indicare la validità della carica residua.Ottimo prodotto, una valida alternativa ai più costosi prodotti di marca di mercato.","February 2, 2022",Italy,B09LCVHCVX

Cuando esto ocurre, el casco izquierdo te avisa de que queda poca bateria y  despues de unos segundos, se apaga.

Took them back and the shop assistant fiddled with the settings and they did function properly until I got back from holiday. The shop sent me a replacement set which worked for a week or so and then lost sound to one of the pod (the original problem) and then as months passed started losing connection regularly when I was out and about.

They are easy to use and useful to have. Unlike other multifunction buttons on earbuds that I've used, these seem to be fairly consistent and can actually pick up on the touches.The one thing that I noticed however, is that after using them a few times, there seemed to be a low buzzing sound coming from the right earbud. I put the earbud back into the case to see if that could rectify the problem, but the buzzing is consistent. It's not the loudest thing, however when you play music, especially music without lyrics, it is quite noticeable. It's not the worst thing that has happened, and chances are it might rectify itself after a couple more charges or so.Overall, for the price that I paid, I'm content with what I've received. They're great value for price, and I'm happy with them. I've used them for around a week or so, so if any issues arise I'll be sure to say!","May 3, 2022",United Kingdom,B09LCVHCVX

Beim Videoanruf wurde mir gesagt, dass man mich wirklich gut und klar hört, wie es draußen in der Umwelt ist, kann ich noch nicht sagen. Der Bass beim Musik hören schnarrt und rauscht nicht, es hallt nichts oder was man sonst so kennt. Ich habe extra bassstarke Lieder ausprobiert und obwohl ich normalerweise volle Lautstärke brauche und mag, ist es bei diesen Kopfhörern nicht so, es muss nicht ""volle Pulle"" sein. Leicht zu bedienen sind sie außerdem, wobei ich sie hauptsächlich über das Smartphone steuere, aber bislang gab es eben keine Probleme irgendwelcher Art.Der Preis war ehrlich gesagt mit am ausschlaggebendsten und ich hatte absolut Glück, sie waren nämlich gerade im Angebot für 30 Euro, aber ich hätte auch sechs Euro mehr gezahlt, ganz ehrlich. Wusste ich vorher halt nicht, weil ich mich an den Bewertungen orientiert habe, da kein Basiswissen vorhanden ist. Aber deshalb schreibe ich diese Rezension, um anderen die Entscheidung hoffentlich ein Stück leichter zu machen. :-)Zur Langlebigkeit kann ich nach zwei Tagen halt noch nichts sagen, aber ansonsten bin ich glücklich mit meiner Wahl und überlege, mir vielleicht sogar wieder eine Hörbuch App anzuschaffen. :-)Fazit: Sehr gute Qualität für kleines Geld.","January 13, 2022",Germany,B09LCVHCVX

Transmiten calidad al verlos. Muy coquetos. La calidad de sonido es buena, sin ser espectacular, pero suenan bien y bonito a un volumen aceptable.

Al no tener alguna almohadilla adaptadora, el auricular con su material más escurridizo, patina dentro de mis orejas, no se aíslan bien del sonido ambiente, ni retienen dentro el sonido de la música. Por la calle, apenas se oyen, precisamente porque el ruido ambiental se introduce y no te permite disfrutar de la música. Además, tienes la sensación de que se te van a caer en cualquier momento.Me puse en contacto con el proveedor y me atendieron estupendamente, ofreciéndome un descuento en los mismos, por no encontrarme satisfecho.

La spedizione impeccabile come sempre. All' interno vi so le cuffie, la custodia, il cavetto per la carica e il manuale. La carica completa delle cuffie è abbastanza veloce. Riponendole semplicemente nella custodia si possono ricaricare circa 3 volte ( massima carica della custodia ovviamente). Ho notato che una cuffietta tende a scaricarsi più velocemente rispetto all'altra. In ogni caso sono abbastanza robuste, mi sono cascate più volte e non si sono rotte. Qualche volta si disconnettono ma si riconnettono da sole, il problema è molto più frequente se le collego al computer.","February 23, 2022",Italy,B09LCVHCVX

La qualità audio e in particolare della chiamata è ottimo anche in ambienti rumorosi o all' aperto. Nell'ascolto della musica come ho letto già in altre recensioni manca effettivamente un pò di equalizzazione e di gestione dei bassi, ma è un di più.Il fitting degli auricolari è ottima, non infastidisce o pesa sul padiglione auricolare, questo permette di non doversi aggiustare continuamente l'auricolare con il rischio di toccare i comandi a sfioro presenti.","May 13, 2022",Italy 🇮🇹,B09LCVHCVX

Para empezar la caja del envoltorio es dura, cuadrada, bien presentada (como los productos de Apple  ode Xiaomi). Los materiales son de calidad, la caja con la batería es muy mona, pequeñita y con cierre con imán, los auriculares muy finos, bien construidos, y el sonido con unos graves suficientes teniendo en cuenta el precio y que no son de fijación de silicona. Además se fijan de forma muy suave y se sujetan muy bien a pesar de los movimientos. Otra cosa que me ha gustado es que, además de las opciones de pausa/play y de avance/retroceso de tracks, tiene también la opción de subir y bajar el volumen, manteniendo el dedo pulsado. Esta funcionalidad no la tienen muchos auriculares. El tema de la batería no lo he probado aún, pero tiene todo tan buena pinta y presentación que dudo que me sorprenda negativamente.Conclusión, unos auriculares económicos pero muy bien terminados, compra completamente recomendable.","January 18, 2022",Spain 🇪🇸,B09LCVHCVX

Here you have a product that is the aural equivalent of listening to a bee in a tincan. There is no bass, no oomph, no sound quality. I have no doubt that voice call reception is clear and clean but I didn't buy ear buds to make phone calls. I have other gadgets for that. I don't care about all the other features these buds may have because they are the worst way to listen to music since those horrible little transistor radios in the 1960's.Absolutely awful. So bad that I'm shocked Amazon sell them let alone endorse them. If these earbuds fell out of a Christmas cracker I would be disappointed.To give you one example: listening to Bob Marley sing One Love through these earbuds makes him sound 14 years old because all the baritone mellow timbre of his mature voice is lost.","October 15, 2022",United Kingdom 🇬🇧,B09LCVHCVX

"Wireless Earbuds, yobola Bluetoth Earbuds, IPX5 Waterproof Wireless Headphones Touch Control, Bluetoth Headphones 5.1 Built-in Microphone, 25 Hrs with USB-C Charging with Running/Fitness",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Vorab: zuvor hatte ich immer mit den normalen Apple Kopfhörern gehört, die es ja jetzt nicht mehr zu neuen Handys dazu gibt und wollte auch schon lange mal was kabelloses (die AirPods sind mir schlicht zu teuer, dafür dass ich sie mal eine halbe Stunde am Tag nutze).Beim Ton höre ich keinen Unterschied zu den Apple Kopfhörern. Auch die Haptik ist gut, wenn man sich die verschiedenen „Tippmuster“ einmal gemerkt hat. Ab und zu funktioniert der Doppelklick nicht, und das Lied pausiert, anstatt dass das nächste gespielt wird -> für mich nicht weiter schlimm.Die Akkuzeit ist für mich auch vollkommen ausreichend. Wenn ich viel höre dann so morgens und mittags jeweils eine Stunde, dazwischen kommen sie in die Ladebox. Über eine Woche habe ich sie jetzt schon, und musste die Box bisher nicht laden.Optik kommt den AirPods sehr nahe.Alles in Allem: TOP kabellose Kopfhörer","February 5, 2022",Germany,B09LCVHCVX

Ein bisschen zu leise und man hört nichts, ein bisschen zu laut und es knirscht in den Ohren, weil die Musik nicht mehr klar hören kann. Der Sound generell hört sich an als wäre man in einem schallenden Raum. Ich hab Kopfhörer für 1/3 des Geldes gekauft mit weitaus besserer Qualität.Zu den Hörern selbst: bei mir haben sie gesessen und auch während der Arbeit sind sie nicht rausgefallen, das ist aber das einzige Gute an ihnen.Eine einzelne Aufladung der Hörer reicht leider nur 6/7 stunden also leider nicht mal für eine komplette Schicht, aber die Box lädt die Hörer relativ schnell auf.Jetzt warum ich nicht höher gehen kann wie 1 Stern: Sie haben einen ganzen Monat gehalten bis ich auf dem linken Ohr nur noch sehr, sehr leise etwas hören konnte. Sie sind nicht runtergefallen, haben kein Wasser abbekommen, ich habe sie lediglich aus der Box geholt und auf einmal hör ich auf dem Linken nichts mehr. Das geht mir anscheinend nicht allein so, das habe ich schon von vielen anderen gelesen hier.Generell nicht zu empfehlen auch nicht als ""billige"" Alternative, weil der Sound ist nicht gut, Telefonieren funktioniert zum Beispiel gar nicht gut (mich hört man nicht und ich höre den anderen in ähnlicher Qualität zu einer U-Bahn Durchsage) und den Preis ist es nicht wert dafür dass sie nach einem Monat kaputt sind.","August 29, 2022",Germany,B09LCVHCVX

Quindi per un utilizzo per strada, il risultato è che alcune cose non si sentono proprio, altre vengono sparate nell'orecchio con un timbro molto fastidioso: quindi mi ritrovavo ad alzare / abbassare il volume continuamente: molto fastidioso. Quindi per riassumere: qualità audio pessima, peccato perché il resto andava più che bene.Un'altro aspetto (minore) che mi dava fastidio era la posizione delle cuffie nel case: ogni volta che aprivo il case per prendere le cuffie erano messe esattamente al contrario rispetto a come dovrei metterle nelle orecchie, in questo modo dovevo prendere la cuffia con una mano (dato che l'altra tiene il case) e con una mano sola girarla in modo tale da farla entrare nell'orecchio: questa procedura fatta due volte (per orecchio) ma soprattutto tante volte nell'arco della giornata diventa pesante.P.S.

La sorpresa vino hace unos días, cuando directamente ya empezaron a fallar por todos los sitios. Los clientes me oían fatal, lejos, con cortes, el micro un desastre... Como ya hacía más de 30 días desde la compra, intenté ponerme en contacto directamente con el vendedor. Resulta que la página web de esta gente, yobola, ni se carga... Además, deber ser de la China, con lo que el soporte técnico imposible, vaya. Por suerte, pude contactar directamente con atención al cliente de Amazon, y la persona que me atendió un 10, me gestionó él mismo la devolución y ya tengo la etiqueta para devolver el producto y el reembolso en curso.Quizá he tenido la mala suerte que me han tocado los auriculares defectuosos, pero en ningún caso recomiendo su compra.

Die Passform im Ohr ist super und sie lassen sich wirklich unproblematisch mit dem Handy koppeln.Inzwischen bin ich jedoch Tag für Tag genervter von den Kopfhörern. Warum?- Sie Tonqualität ist für den Preis okay, aber natürlich kein Vergleich zu AirPods. Ich finde, dem Ton fehlt die Tiefe, Bass ist kaum vorhanden. Teilweise tun die Ohren auch schon nach kurzer Zeit weh. Bei meinen AirPods ist jedoch das Mikro kaputt, sodass ich sie nicht mehr zum telefonieren verwenden kann und deswegen Ersatz gesucht habe.- Die Mikrofonqualität scheint nicht besonders zu sein. Anrufer verstehen mich oft nur sehr schlecht und ich muss schreien. Anrufe brechen manchmal ab, weil das Headset selbstständig auflegt, wenn man z.B. im Liegen telefoniert.- Bedienung über Tippen auf die Ohrhörer nicht intuitiv und vor allem viel zu sensitiv.

I'd turn them down and was then able to see the volume bar slowly rise again.the other issue is that they seem to skip songs. you can listen to a minute or so and then it skips to the next one, then the next and then the next.I'm guessing that it thinks the buttons are being pressed when they aren't.all this is a massive shame as apart from this (which makes them unusable) they are great and would have earnt 5 stars.I'll look to see if there is a reset on them to see if that will fix the issues, but if i cant, or it doesn't, they will be getting returned.UPDATE - Emailed support and they got back to me pretty quickly with a list of things to try.Unfortunately none of the things they asked me to do worked so I have returned them for a refund.","May 12, 2022",United Kingdom 🇬🇧,B09LCVHCVX
