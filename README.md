# Fake-Review-Detection

A set of seven self-defined labeling rules were proposed for identifying fake product reviews. These rules were used as a rubric to hand label 2,011 Amazon reviews for the Yobola Wireless Earbuds product. A baseline accuracy rate for predicting a given review’s label by guessing only ‘Not Suspicious’ was determined  to be 75.83%. A suspicious product review prediction accuracy of 81.0% was achieved utilizing random forest classification in conjunction with latent semantic analysis. Surprisingly, no significant differences  were observed between suspicious and not-suspicious product reviews for both Vader (Hutto, C.J. & Gilbert, E.E) determined product review sentiment and average product review ratings suggesting the complexity of fake review detection.
